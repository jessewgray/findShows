To finally complete our sophomore album, sit back and listen to what we have done is a great feeling.

       " {'name': 'Adam Ant',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Adam Ant is the stage name of Stuart Leslie Goddard (born November 3, 1954, London, England), lead singer of 1980s pop group Adam and the Ants and also a solo artist.  \\n\\nAdam was a member of Bazooka Joe, the band that the Sex Pistols opened for in the Pistols\\' first live appearance. Adam and the Ants started as a punk band, but by the early \\'80s they had taken a different path and started making pop music. By 1981 they were one of the biggest bands in Britain.\\n\\nIn March 1982, feeling certain band members \"lacked enthusiasm\", Ant disbanded the group. A few months after the split Ant launched a solo career (though he retained Marco Pirroni as guitarist and co-songwriter).\\n\\nAfter the split, Ant went solo, taking his song writing partner Pirroni with him. His greatest American chart success was 1982\\'s Friend or Foe album, which included the hit single \"Goody Two Shoes\" which made it to #1 in the UK and Australia, and #12 in the U.S. Other hits from that album included the title song (which made #9 on the UK chart) and \"Desperate But Not Serious\". Goody Two Shoes first charted in the UK in Spring 1982, reaching no.1 that summer, but its US peak did not come until 1983 when it reached #12 on the Billboard Top 100.\\n\\nIn 1983, Ant worked with Phil Collins and Richard James Burgess on the \"Strip\" album which was recorded at Polar Studios in Stockholm. The single \"Puss \\'N Boots\" reached #5 on the UK charts, but the BBC banned both the video and the song for the follow-up single \"Strip,\" which peaked at #41. Although Strip had some highlights and hit singles, it marked the end of his reign as one of Britain\\'s top pop stars for a while. That same year, Ant also memorably appeared as a guest performer on the NBC television network\\'s Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever special that aired in May.\\n\\nIn 1985, he worked with veteran producer Tony Visconti on his third solo album, \"Vive Le Rock\". He secured a spot at the Live Aid concert, but was asked to cut his set to one song. He chose his new single, \"Vive le Rock.\" Vive Le Rock was intended to be his ultimate hard rock album but the single underwent a pressing error and the album received mixed reviews. As a result, Adam decided to end his career in music and focus on his acting career.\\n\\nIn 1989, whilst maintaining an interest in acting, Ant returned to America and re-entered the pop music world with the album \"Manners & Physique\", a collaboration with André Cymone, a solo artist and an early member of Prince\\'s band. The album was another moderate success, and featured the UK and U.S. hit single \"Room at the Top\". \"Rough Stuff\" became the second single for the United States and Germany as \"Can\\'t Set Rules About Love\" charted in the United Kingdom.\\n\\nIn 1993, he toured in support of a planned album called \"Persuasion\". On account of a regime change at MCA, the record company made the unilateral decision not to release this album on the basis that Manners & Physique had failed to achieve a gold sales certification. Ant was subsequently released from his contract with MCA and later signed by EMI. Persuasion remains unreleased to this day and, as a result, it has become something of a lost legend among \"Antfans\", although it is widely available online for download.\\n\\nIn 1995, Ant released the album \"Wonderful\". The title track was a successful single, as was a tour of the U.S. in support of the album. While Ant and his group (which retained longtime guitarist Pirroni) played in smaller venues than they had played in the 1980s, the houses were often packed with enthusiastic fans. The tour was cut short due to Ant and Pirroni both contracting glandular fever (for those who don\\'t know the term, glandular fever is generally a euphemism for what usually manifests as mononucleosis).\\n\\n\"Adam Ant Is the Blueblack Hussar in Marrying the Gunner\\'s Daughter\" is the sixth solo studio album by Adam Ant. The album\\'s title was announced by Ant in the NME in April 2010. As per Adam\\'s announcement at his gig in Chatham in September 2012, the new album was released on 21 January 2013 by Ant\\'s own record label Blueblack Hussar Records. Despite the independent self-release, the album reached number 25 on the UK Albums Chart, only one place lower than its predecessor, released on the major EMI label nearly eighteen years earlier. It had previously been at number 8 in the Midweeks. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Adam+Ant\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His self-titled debut album is full of folk and soul, with a jazz twist.  The Flower Songfacts state that his fourth album, Mission Bell, which was released on January 25, 2011 debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200 with 40,000 copies sold in its first week; these sales were the lowest for a #1 debut in the Nielsen SoundScan era.\\n\\nLee grew up in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cherry Hill, New Jersey, USA. He has been quoted as saying that he is fortunate to have seen different sides of life in America. Lee enrolled at the University of South Carolina in 1995. He began to play guitar and write songs seriously while he studied English. After graduating with an English degree, Lee moved back to Philadelphia to teach elementary school. He later made the tough decision to stop teaching in order to pursue a career in music. Shortly thereafter, he released a self-produced EP that featured five of his original songs, which did extremely well in Philadelphia and created a buzz. Norah Jones was the person who finally gave Lee his big breakthrough when she asked him to open for her 2004 tour. Lee then went on to produce his self-titled debut album. In March and April of 2005 Lee opened for the tour that Merle Haggard and Bob Dylan were both embarking on, all 3 performers were extremely well received by critics as the tour went by, with Dylan receiving some of his strongest reviews in years. On October 3, 2006, Lee released his second album, \"Supply & Demand\" to critical and commercial acclaim.\\n\\nAt the age of only 27, Amos Lee has enjoyed notable success with his debut album and looks to have a promising future in the music business.

       " {'name': 'Andrew Bird',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Andrew Bird (born July 11, 1973) is an American musician. He was born in Lake Bluff, Illinois and resides in the Chicago area. Bird is a singer, a violinist and, since 2004, a guitarist. He is also an accomplished whistler.\\n\\nHis early work, which echoed gypsy jazz and traditional folk, has led into his current sound, which mixes rock with more broad compositions. His years of solo song-craft have now enabled him to produce a sound that is uniquely his own.\\n\\nTrained by the Suzuki method from a young age and a graduate of Illinois\\' Northwestern University, Bird released his first solo album, Music of Hair, in  1996. Vastly different from his later releases, this first album showcases his violin skills and pays tribute to his fascination with both American and European folk traditions, as well as jazz and blues.\\n\\nHis initial commercial exposure was in collaborative work with the band Squirrel Nut Zippers. He was quickly lumped in with the swing craze that swept the United States music industry in the mid \\'90s; this is an affiliation that he is still working to shed.\\n\\nTaking on the role of band leader in 1997 with Andrew Bird\\'s Bowl of Fire, he released the album Thrills. This was followed by Oh! The Grandeur in 1998. Both albums were heavily influenced by traditional folk, pre-war jazz and swing, with Bird relying on the violin as his primary musical instrument.\\n\\nIn 2001, Bird released The Swimming Hour, his third release with the Bowl of Fire and a dramatic departure from previous recordings. The Swimming Hour featured a mixture of styles, from the zydeco-influenced \"Core and Rind\" to more straightforward rock songs. He has often referred to this record as his \"jukebox album\".\\n\\nThe Bowl of Fire unofficially disbanded some time in 2003, having featured many skilled Chicago musicians including Kevin O\\'Donnell, Nora O\\'Connor, Andy Hopkins (aka Mr. Rudy Day), Jimmy Sutton, Colin Bunn and Ryan Hembrey.\\n\\nBird then released two subsequent solo albums, both distributed through the label operated by Ani DiFranco, Righteous Babe Records. The two records, 2003\\'s Weather Systems and 2005\\'s The Mysterious Production of Eggs, continue a progression towards an eclectic indie folk sound that has proven challenging to classify.\\n\\nBird\\'s live solo shows have been notable in that he uses a multi-track system to sample and loop his own performance. For example, he may record a snippet of his performance on violin, then play a \"loop\" of that sound. This provides a more full-bodied sound and aurally suggests a band performance, rather than the sound of a solo artist.\\n\\nBird\\'s next full-length album Armchair Apocrypha (Fat Possum) was released on March 20th 2007.\\n\\nNovember 2007 saw the Soldier On EP originally a European tour-only release. But due to high demand and unanticipated critical acclaim was released digitally and in CD-format on both sides of the Atlantic. Critics and fans alike have hearkened to the EP\\'s first track, \"The Trees Were Mistaken\", a complex yet austere looping composition that marks a departure from Bird\\'s earlier body of work. It also contains a cover of Bob Dylan\\'s \"Oh Sister\".\\n\\nJanuary 2009 saw Noble Beast, also available with instrumental album Useless Creatures, released worldwide to positive reviews.\\n\\nThe Fatal Shore Songfacts reports that Break it Yourself, Bird\\'s sixth solo studio album, was released on March 6, 2012 through Mom+Pop records in the US and Bella Union in the UK. The origins of the LP lie in a couple of jam sessions by a gathering of Bird\\'s friends in the singer\\'s western Illinois barn, near the banks of the Mississippi River.\\n\\nOf his 2019 album My Finest Work Yet, Talia Schlanger of NPR says \"Bird zooms way out on humanity across history\\'s timeline, seeking insight about our current age, in a way he hopes \\'stays above the news feed noise.\\'\"  Many tracks, including the opener \"Sisyphus,\" include Andrew\\'s trademark whistling. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Bird\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'August Burns Red is a band from Manheim, Pennsylvania. Formed in 2003, the group began their first performances while a majority of the members were attending their senior year of high school, and soon began playing shows around Lancaster, before being signed to CI Records, and afterward, Solid State Records (SST). The group is primarily known for their heavy breakdowns, highly melodic guitar riffs and odd-meter riffs. They state Between the Buried and Me, Misery Signals and Hopesfall as their main influences.\\n\\nAugust Burns Red is generally credited as a melodic metalcore band, and have also been said to share traits of other genres such as progressive metal, and thrash metal but blending it with hardcore, extreme metal and post hardcore August Burns Red songs have technical or odd time signatures and heavy breakdowns, growled vocals, melodic guitar riffs, and complex instrumentation with a variety of influences including Meshuggah, Between the Buried and Me, Poison the Well, Symphony in Peril and Misery Signals.\\n\\nWhile the group has stated that they don\\'t mind being classified as melodic metalcore, Brubaker has grown to a distaste in the genre\\'s usual bands: \"I feel like anyone who can pick up and play a guitar and learn to play a metalcore riff and any drummer who can learn to play a thrash beat over a breakdown is doing it. It\\'s almost become very formulaic, and metal to me was never a formulaic genre.\"\\n\\nAugust Burns Red was founded in March 2003 when all the members were attending high school. The original practice sessions of the band began in drummer, Matt Greiner\\'s old egg house and basement on the Greiner family\\'s farmland.

       " {'name': 'Belle and Sebastian',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Belle and Sebastian is a band from Glasgow. Led by guitarist/vocalist Stuart Murdoch, the seven-piece band has an intimate, majestic sound that is equal parts folk-rock and \\'60s pop. Murdoch has a gift not only for whimsy and surrealism, but also for odd, unsettling lyrical detail which keeps the songs grounded in a tangible reality. \\n\\nBased in Glasgow, Scotland, Belle and Sebastian released their first two albums in 1996: Tigermilk, recorded over three days, and If You\\'re Feeling Sinister, recorded in a week, at the peak of the chamber pop movement. At first, some critics in Britain\\'s music weeklies tied the band into the subgenre, yet the group was too pretty, too delicate, to bear that label. Through their first two years of public existence, the band shielded their personalities, submitting publicity photos featuring a girl, who was a friend of the band and reluctantly posing for photo shoots. Furthermore, they performed in odd venues, playing not only the standard coffeehouses and cafes, but also homes, church halls, and libraries.\\n\\nPrior to the formation of Belle and Sebastian, Murdoch suffered from a protracted battle with chronic fatigue syndrome, which forced him to drop out of school and spend seven years living in his parents\\' home crippled by his condition.Whilst in his parents home, Murdoch wrote a short story about a boy named Sebastian and a girl named Isabelle  based on the names from Madame Cecile Aubery\\'s children\\'s book Belle et Sebastian. On New Year\\'s Day 1996, Stuart attended a party at which he met a young singer and cellist named Isobel Campbell. In a letter to his brother Fraser, Murdoch explained how he was making a single for Stow college at the end of February. Murdoch opted to use the name Belle&Sebastian for the project because it was occupying him at the time.  Murdoch took to songwriting as an escapism from the four walls surrounding him in his room and eventually recorded demos with bassist Stuart David whom he met at a government training programme called Beatbox. Murdoch quickly met a series of other musicians through social and musical circles in his hometown Glasgow and they agreed to help with the Stow project. The members he found for this initial lineup were Stevie Jackson (guitar), Mick Cooke (trumpet), Chris Geddes (keyboards), Stuart David (bass), Richard Colburn (drums), and Isobel Campbell (cello). The Stow College record was to be issued by Electric Honey, but it turned into a full album. The course instructor Alan Rankine determined that Murdoch had enough good material to record a full LP and could do so if they could get it all done in three days, studio time allotted for the single. Murdoch and his musicians rose to the challenge and recorded ten tracks putting the songs in order as they would appear on the record and mostly completing them in just a few takes. \\n\\nIn May of 1996, Belle and Sebastian self-released their debut album, Tigermilk, on Electric Honey Records. Only 1,000 copies of the album, which was only pressed on vinyl, were released, but it unexpectedly became a sensation, earning terrific word of mouth throughout the UK. As a result, the band became slightly more than a school project — it became an actual band. If You\\'re Feeling Sinister, released on the independent Jeepster label, followed in November of 1996. By the time the album was released in America on the EMI subsidiary The Enclave, it had earned considerable critical acclaim in the U.K. — not only from music weeklies, but from newspapers like The Sunday Times and magazines like The Face — and a large cult following; by some accounts, Tigermilk was being sold for as much as 75 pounds. Over the course of 1997, word of mouth continued to grow in America, even as the band pulled out of an American tour because The Enclave went bankrupt and closed.\\n\\nAs the band cult continued to build in 1997, Belle and Sebastian released three EPs — Dog on Wheels (May), Lazy Line Painter Jane (July), and 3.. 6.. 9 Seconds of Light (October). Each subsequent EP placed higher on the indie charts and received great critical acclaim. Later in the year, violinist Sarah Martin became a member of the band. By the end of the year, the group finalized an American deal with Matador Records, issuing The Boy With the Arab Strap in September 1998. The following year saw the eagerly anticipated wide re-release of Tigermilk, the album that started it all. It was the biggest selling album but is unpopular with the group themselves. Following completion of 2000\\'s Fold Your Hands Child, You Walk Like a Peasant, Stuart David left Belle and Sebastian to focus full-time on his solo project, Looper, being replaced by Bobby Kildea of V-Twin. In 2001, the group released two EPs — Jonathan David and I\\'m Waking Up to Us — and recorded the soundtrack for Todd Solondz\\'s film Storytelling. Just before the soundtrack\\'s release in spring 2002, Belle and Sebastian embarked on a comprehensive tour of the United States and Canada before returning to Europe for the summer festival season. Midway through the tour, Isobel Campbell left the band, citing the usual differences. \\n\\nAnother major change that soon took place was the band leaving Jeepster and Matador to sign with Rough Trade, with their next record, late 2003\\'s Dear Catastrophe Waitress, produced by the inimitable Trevor Horn (who also produced Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Yes, and scores of others). The record spawned the brilliant \"Step into My Office, Baby\" and \"I\\'m a Cuckoo\" singles, the latter of which was the group\\'s biggest U.K. hit, reaching number 14 in early 2004. After a long worldwide tour that found Belle and Sebastian reaching new levels of success, they retired to Scotland and began preparing for the recording of their seventh full length album, The Life Pursuit, released in 2006. \\nIn 2010, they released their eighth full length album, Write About Love.\\n\\nOfficial website: www.belleandsebastian.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Belle+and+Sebastian\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

He is currently a member of Wolfsbane, he is also the former singer of the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden. Blaze Bayley has released 6th studio albums to date, as well as 2 live albums and 2 DVDs. \\n\\nBlaze (1999-2007)\\n\\nFollowing Blaze Bayley\\'s departure from Iron Maiden in 1999, he formed his own band, BLAZE, in March that year. Bayley recruited guitarist Steve Wray, guitarist John Slater, bassist Rob Naylor, and drummer Jeff Singer, and signed a deal with German label SPV, releasing the band\\'s debut studio album in 2000, Silicon Messiah. The album was followed up by Tenth Dimension in 2002 and the band\\'s first live album in 2003, As Live As It Gets.\\n\\nAfter recording the live album, Jeff Singer announced he was leaving the band. Three months later, Rob Naylor was also leaving. Session drummer Phil Greenhouse and bassist Wayne Banks were hired for the rest of the Tenth Dimension tour until permanent replacements could be found. Guitarist Jason Banks was drafted in for a few gigs at the end of 2003 to cover for John Slater.\\n\\nAt the end of 2003, Blaze began writing material for their third studio album, Blood & Belief. Phil Greenhouse was replaced on drums by Jason Bowld for recording and Dave Knight for touring. The band began to tour for the album shortly after it was released in 2004, but were set back again by the news that John Slater could not perform a large section of the tour. Despite rejoining the band later in the year, Slater eventually left the band in September with Steve Wray to form the band Rise To Addiction. Bassist Wayne Banks and drummer Dave Knight left the band to join the Robin Gibb band in September 2004.\\n\\nBlaze performed a number of shows in 2004 and 2005 with the lineup of Bayley, guitarist Oliver Palotai, guitarist Luca Princiotta, bassist Nick Douglas, and drummer Daniel Löble. The two guitarists were eventually kept on as full members. The band\\'s lineup shifted once again when Löble quit to join German power metal band Helloween early in 2005 and when Douglas returned to another German heavy metal band, Doro. The two were replaced by unknown German musicians Daniel Schild and Christian Ammann respectively. With the new line up, Blaze began to work on a fourth studio album for a release in 2007, but in January that year it was announced the entire line-up had to part ways with Bayley due to serious financial matters.

       "  'bio': 'Buckcherry is a band formed in Los Angeles back in 1995. The band released two albums before dissolving in summer 2002 after lead singer Josh Todd left to pursue a solo career. The band reformed in 2005 with a completely new rhythm section to release their third album on April 11th 2006, entitled \\'15\\', the album consist of the bands two biggest hits to date \"Crazy Bitch\" and \"Sorry\"\\n\\nSound\\n\\nComing out during a time when rock music was dominated by post-grunge, nu-metal, and alternative rock, Buckcherry performed a sleazy Rock N\\' Roll that was more inspired by AC/DC, Guns N\\' Roses, and Black Crowes than Nirvana and Pearl Jam. On their debut record, they successfully trod heavy metal territory while managing to stay hard rock, while on Time Bomb, the band took their sleaze to an extreme with an excess of profanity and attitude.\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nBuckcherry was formed after Josh Todd met guitarist Keith Nelson through their tattoo artist after discovering a common love of AC/DC. The duo made a few demos before being joined by bassist Jonathan Brightman and drummer Devon Glenn. Buckcherry began preforming the Hollywood club scene, recieving a strong, local following due to their old school Rock N\\' Roll vibe.\\n\\nThe band added a second guitarist, Yogi, and were signed to DreamWorks Records shortly after. The band released their self titled debut in 1999 to critical praise. The album, produced by Terry Date, who produced albums for Soundgarden, Mother Love Bone, and Pantera, and ex-Sex Pistol Steve Jones, produced three modern rock chart hits with the singles, Lit Up, Check Your Head, and For The Movies.\\n\\nThe band\\'s profile had been raised by summer 2000 with help from touring and decided to release their follow up album Time Bomb in 2001. The album was considered a disappointment after the very promising debut by many critics, and naturally, didn\\'t fare as well as the first on the charts. The All Music Guide noted that \"For a second record, it\\'s surprising how jaded and nihilistic they are already.\"\\n\\nBuckcherry performed opening dates for heroes AC/DC in the spring and recieved increased fanfare. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Josh Todd left the band to pursue a solo career in July 2002, leading to the bands demise.\\n\\nThe band was held on ice for over two years while Todd pursued a solo career. The post-grunge solo effort You Made Me turned out to be a failure, leading to Todd and Nelson to reform Buckcherry in early 2005. Joined by rhythm guitarist Stevie D., bassist Jimmy Ashhurst, and drummer Xavier Muriel, the band recorded their third album Fifteen and released it exclusively in Japan.\\n\\nThe band had been asked to open for Mõtley Crūe for a Japanese leg in December 2005, and began a headlining club tour in Spring 2006 a few weeks prior to the release of their third album, Fifteen. The album debuted at No.48 on the Billboard Top 200, selling over 26,000 copies in its 1st week. In May 2006, it was announced that the band had signed a deal with Atlantic Records via long-term deal with Eleven Seven Music. Their latest album is now being marketed by Lava/Atlantic, and reached a new peak of #41 on the Billboard Top 200 in the August 19, 2006 issue.\\n\\nWith \"Crazy Bitch\", Buckcherry gained their second major mainstream hit (following \"Lit Up\"), as the song hit #3 on the Mainstream Rock chart, #13 on Modern Rock, and became the first Buckcherry song to cross over to the Billboard Hot 100, where it hit #59, and also landed at #52 on the Billboard Pop 100, and #37 on Billboard\\'s Hot Digital Songs chart. The song\\'s success was largely driven by its success on the radio, as MTV rejected the band\\'s initial video, demanding more than 80 cuts.\\n\\nOn Tuesday, May 30th, 2006, after a fan-made video for \"Crazy Bitch\" spread across the internet, the band, in a posting that appeared on their MySpace and Buckcherry.com, announced that they were accepting submissions from fans with their own videos, and would feature more interpretations of \"Crazy Bitch\" in the weeks to come. The original fan video was later submitted to MTV, before being passed over in favor of an edited version of the original clip, with added live footage.\\n\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Buckcherry\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Built to Spill',\n",
       "  'bio': '\\nBuilt to Spill is an indie rock band based in Boise, Idaho, United States. The band is best known for its catchy guitar hooks and the unique voice of frontman Doug Martsch.\\n\\nFormer Treepeople frontman Doug Martsch formed Built to Spill in 1992 with Brett Netson and Ralf Youtz as the band\\'s original members. In an interview with Spin magazine, Martsch stated that he intended to change the band\\'s lineup for every album, with Martsch being the only permanent member. After the band\\'s first album, Ultimate Alternative Wavers (1993), the lineup changing idea held true, as both Netson and Youtz were replaced by Brett Nelson (not Netson) and Andy Capps for 1994\\'s There\\'s Nothing Wrong With Love. A compilation album called The Normal Years, consisting of recordings by both the first and second trios, was released in 1996. Between recording albums in 1995, the band gained notoriety by playing on the Lollapalooza tour.\\n\\nMartsch signed Built To Spill to the Warner Brothers label in 1995. Unlike many artists signed to major labels, however, the deal the band brokered with Warner allowed it to retain a large degree of creative control over future albums. Built to Spill produced its first major label release in 1997 with Perfect From Now On. By this time, the band consisted of Martsch, Nelson, Netson, and Scott Plouf. Perfect From Now On met with critical success and caused Built To Spill to become one of the United States\\' most recognizable indie rock bands. Before releasing another album, Martsch made Nelson and Plouf permanent members of the band. In 1999, the band released Keep It Like a Secret to continued critical success, and for the first time, significant commercial success. In response to fan requests, the Live album was released in 2000. The band\\'s fifth studio album, Ancient Melodies of the Future, was released in 2001. Martsch also released Now You Know, a solo album with both blues and folk elements, in 2002. After 2002, Warner Bros. records signed the band to another album.\\n\\nBuilt To Spill did not tour as a band in 2002 although Doug Martsch performed numerous solo concerts in support of his solo album. From 2003 to 2005, Built To Spill toured extensively with over 150 live performances, playing new songs live as early as 2004. In 2004, the band confirmed rumors that they had recorded another studio album in Portland, OR, titled You In Reverse. The album was not released in 2005 due to difficulties associated with the use of a new recording facility, inefficiencies associated with self-producing the album and time constraints. You In Reverse, the first studio album in five years, was released on April 11, 2006. The band\\'s official lineup for the album featured Martsch, Nelson, Plouf, and Jim Roth, who was formerly a touring guitarist only. Former band member Brett Netson provided guitar work on several songs, Quasi\\'s Sam Coomes provided keyboard work and Steve Lobdell, the owner of the Portland studio, plays on almost every song for the album including guitar, piano, vibes and percussion. Netson rejoined Built To Spill as an official member in 2006 after touring with the band in 2005.\\n\\nThe band announced an April/May 2006 tour in February 2006 in support of the new album. In late March 2006, however, frontman Doug Martsch suffered a detached retina that required surgery, causing the band to cancel its appearance at the South by Southwest music festival and postpone several of their tour dates. The band rescheduled the April and May tour dates in the fall, but most June dates on the West were not postponed. At their June 3, 2006 show, their first of the 2006 tour, Built to Spill played four unreleased songs that were not included on You In Reverse. This show also included the dedication of the song \"Car\" to former band member Andy Capps who had passed away a few weeks earlier that would continue throughout the tour.\\n\\nIn July 2007, Built To Spill released a new 12\" vinyl single with two reggae-esque tracks, \"They Got Away\" and \"Re-Arrange\". According to Doug Martsch, BTS is not becoming a reggae band, they just \"love to play it\". \\n\\n\\n In 2009 Nelson replayed and recorded one song off of each full length Built To Spill album in \"\"New Wave circa 1982\" style with analogue synthesizers and a drum machine having Martsch resing all of the songs and released it July 2010 through CDBABY,Itunes and Junketboy as The Electronic Anthology Project.Nelson\\'s son (Nicholas)  did the art/layout with the titles reworked as anagrams by his wife (Stephanie) he plans on future projects under the same moniker redoing other bands music.\\n\\nDoug Martsch and original BTS drummer Ralf Youtz are also founding members of the much-loved, but short-lived, band the Halo Benders, with Calvin Johnson.\\n\\nYoutz and Martsch are also brothers-in-law. (Martsch is married to Youtz\\'s sister).\\n\\nRalf Youtz was leader of the Portland, Oregon band Ape Shape. He went on to pursue a Ph.D. in Mathematics. \\n\\nBret Netson is leader of the influential art/metal Boise band Caustic Resin, which put out a split 10\" with BTS in 1995. That album has two different cover photos because a found photo was used without permission for the original version, but the photographer later found out and objected.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Built+to+Spill\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It’s a time that occurs in everyone’s life that cannot be remembered or recalled, this therefore, explorative aspect to his song-writing shows the depth Cunningham has to offer, unlike so many artists of his type. The song manages to convey an impression of diving in and out from the confusion of that foreign experience in such a compelling nature, accompanied by intense vocals playing on the track’s intimacy. “Outside Things’” carries with it a strange sense of longing, which is continuous throughout the EP.\\n\\n“In One Out” is the first track to be heard on the record; it’s melodic, but profoundly sombre and relatively dark sounding. The finger-picked guitar behind the vocals is hypnotic. There’s a slight step away from this intensity of the opening track and that of the title track in “Lights Off” and “Plans” - the second and fourth tracks on the EP. With far less movement there’s time to breathe between songs, it really helps to make each one stand out in their own right. During both of these tracks Cunningham creates moments of silence, with constant breaks where everything comes to a brief halt – if you heard these tracks live you’d want to be situated in an intimate and silent setting.\\n\\nThe Outside Things EP not only demonstrates Cunningham’s impeccable writing ability, but his intricate and skilful playing technique, developed and picked up from his time spent in Seville, along with showing off his individual voice. Through the EP Cunningham’s percussive, yet flexible guitars playing technique is something to be whole heartedly admired. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Charlie+Cunningham\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': '\\n\"Choir Boy\" was what kids called singer/songwriter Adam Klopp in his early teens when he fronted punk cover bands in Cleveland, Ohio. An intended insult, the label seemed fair and fitting in a way, given Klopp\\'s religious upbringing and angelic voice. After high school, Adam left Ohio for college in Utah. While his career as a student would prove short-lived, he integrated into Provo and SLC\\'s underground music and art scene, left religion behind, and called his new band \"Choir Boy\".\\n\\n\"It seemed funny to me as sort of a comical reclamation of the mocking title I received from \"punk\" peers as a teen. While serving as a weird reflection of my childhood and musical heritage.\"\\n\\nSince Choir Boy\\'s gorgeous debut LP on Team Love records in 2016, the dream-pop outfit has gained a cult following online and in underground circles, and signed to LA/NY based label DAIS Records in 2017. Adam\\'s stunning vocal range, layered compositions, and heartbreaking melodies are backed by musical partner Chaz Costello on Bass (Fossil Arms, SculptureClub, Human Leather) - and along with a rotating cast of players, create the perfect blend of nostalgia-laced romantic pop music we\\'ve been waiting years to hear. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Choir+Boy\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band consists of Ruth Radelet (vocals, guitar, synthesizer), Adam Miller (guitar), Johnny Jewel (synthesizer, production) and Nat Walker (drums, synthesizer). The band shifted from a post-punk sound to one inspired by 1980s synthpop and Italo disco around 2006; Miller is the only member who remains from the original incarnation of the band, although the lineup has been relatively consistent since their change in musical direction. Their most recent full length album, \"Kill for Love\" was released in 2012.\\n\\nThe band  originally hailed from Seattle and formed in 2002 as a quartet featuring vocalist Adam Miller, drummer Hannah Blilie, guitarist Devin Welch, and bassist Michelle Nolan. That lineup debuted in 2002 with a Calvin Johnson-produced 7\" on Gold Standard Laboratories -- a split with Die Monitr Batss -- and followed with the similarly GSL-issued Chrome Rats vs Basement Ruts LP.  \\n\\nWhile Chrome Rats was critically hailed, Chromatics couldn\\'t keep it together, and Miller was soon the only member in good standing (Blilie, Welch, and Nolan went on to form the similar-sounding Shoplifting). Unworried, Miller added guitar and drum programming to his vocal duties and tapped bassist Nat Sahlstrom for the 2003 GSL 7\" Ice Hatchets. That was followed by the February 2004 full-length Plaster Hounds (which featured the percussion work of Get Hustle\\'s Ron Avila), and a repositioning of the Chromatics axis to greater reflect its dub and no wave influences. \\n\\nThis lineup too dissolved and Adam Miller relocated Chromatics to Portland, teaming up with Glass Candy\\'s Johnny Jewel, Ruth Radelet  on lead vocals, and Nat Walker on percussion and saxophone.

       " {'name': 'Clan of Xymox',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Clan of Xymox (also known as Xymox) blend an eclectic and vibrant mix of darkwave, synthpop, and gothic rock. From the Netherlands, Xymox was established in 1983 in Nijmegen by frontman Ronny Moorings and then live-in Anke Wolbert. Their first EP, \"Subsequent Pleasures\" added Pieter Nooten afterwards on keyboards and left a mark on an emerging Euro-wave market. \\n\\nA chance meeting with Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard of Dead Can Dance led to an invitation to support that band on a UK tour, and then a recording contract with their record label, 4AD.\\n\\nTheir first two full length albums, self-titled \"Clan of Xymox\" and \"Medusa\", comfortably settled Xymox into their own niche of blooming melodics and smooth grey lyrical originality, with Ronny\\'s songwriting coming as a fresh and very welcome abstract to the plastic and packaged synthpop of the late 80s. In 1989, Ronny saw a chance to evolve and left 4AD, releasing Twist of Shadows which proved to be their most complete and mature offering thusfar, and was their most successful yet. \\n\\nWith the next two albums, \"Phoenix\" and \"Metamorphosis\", fans were left with something of an out of body experience - as Xymox was sounding nothing like themselves. Metamorphosis was truly that however, its failure created a catalyst for Moorings to jump to yet another label, part ways with his bandmates, and pickup Mojca Zugna on bass. Zok records re-released \"Metamorphosis\" and a new EP - Headclouds. Moorings took a four year break (he worked on 2 CD-Rom games music projects of Domark ) to introspect and write, and gave fans the wondrous gift that is Hidden Faces, admittedly the logical followup to \"Medusa\".\\nAfter leaving Wing in the early nineties, Xymox became the sole signing to the independent label, Zok Records. They released four recordings, primarily in the dance genre: \"Metamorphosis\", \"Headclouds\", one remix CD, and they re-released \"Subsequent Pleasures\".\\n\\nIn 1997, the band reclaimed their original name, Clan of Xymox, and began the work of reclaiming their original sound and glory. \"Hidden Faces\", produced by Dave Allen (of Sisters fame) and John Rivers (of Love and Rockets note) hearkened back to the 4AD years, and although it did not completely regain the power of their initial sound ( not intended either), it was clearly the best work they had done since \"Medusa\". This release was followed by a number of American and European dates, including co-headlining the Zillo and Leipzig festivals in Germany. In relation to these intriguing live shows, Pandemonium records released two singles \"Out of the Rain\" and \"This World\" which rose to the top 10 in the German Independent Charts.\\n\\nIn 1999, Clan of Xymox signed on with Metropolis Records, and delivered \"Creatures\" to a public that had been waiting for the true follow-up to 1985\\'s \"Clan of Xymox\" album for 14 years. \"Creatures\" not only captures the sound of their amazing debut (which has also been reissued in 1999 along with \"Medusa\"), but infuses it with the dark rock and Gothic guitar styles of such masterful bands as Andrew Eldritch\\'s Sisters of Mercy.\\n\\n2000 marked a first for the Clan of Xymox. After thousands of requests from fans for a live album, Clan of Xymox returned with \"Live\", a double live CD which featured nineteen tracks and two QuickTime videos. All of the tracks were recorded during their Central and South American tour in 1999, and could almost be considered a best of. A re-issue of the ever increasingly hard to find \"Subsequent Pleasures\" EP featuring many obscure pre-4AD demos, as well as a new single, \"Liberty,\" followed.\\n\\nMetropolis\\'s second studio album by the Clan of Xymox was 2001\\'s \"Notes from the Underground.\" It combined haunting yet atmospheric synth lines with dark rhythms, powerful beats and lively guitar strumming to yield a release based on agony and anguish caused by being disconnected from society. A double remix CD was released the year after titled \"Remixes from the Underground,\" featuring the mixing talents of Front 242, Beborn Beton, Iris, Assemblage23 and many more.\\n\\nClan of Xymox spent the two years following \"Notes from the Underground\" Combining elements from their past, present, and future, Clan of Xymox mix haunting and atmospheric synth lines with dark rhythms, powerful beats and lively guitar strumming to yield an album based on agony and anguish caused by being disconnected from society ( as described by musicfolio) to work on their next record, \"Farewell,\" which was released in 2003. \"Farewell\" yielded club-friendly songs sitting comfortably along side moody atmospheric tracks to create a hybrid which can only remotely be described as Dark Goth Electro. The basic theme that runs through \"Farewell\" is about leaving everything behind and going away, which can be exhibited through the lyrics that tell the sad and bitter tales of love and relationships.\\n\\nOne year later, the band released their first \\'best of\\' CD simply titled, \"The Best of Clan of Xymox.\" In the words of Ronny Moorings, \"…The most difficult task was to pick the best of songs…but with the help of our fans who voted for their favorite songs on-line we finally got the resulting tracks… Whilst listening to the final running order as listed here I just got swept from period to period, remembering all kind of people and situations. I am sure you too will have memories with certain tracks, so all I want to say to you now is: cherish your moments in life!\"\\n\\nFor 2006, Clan of Xymox released the \"Weak in My Knees\" digital single as a precursor to the upcoming full length, \"Breaking Point.\" The new album exhibited a more mature sound than on its predecessors, and leaned more towards dark rock than gothic rock. Subtle keyboards overlaid with guitars and live drum sounds were the focal points of the release. However not to be outdone by the music alone, Ronny Moorings’s deep sensuous vocals accentuated the music and brought forth the deeper meanings of the songs - such as in \"Calling You Out,\" \"Eternally\" and \"We Never Learn.\"\\n\\n2008 saw the first (European P.A.L) )release of their first double DVD, including videos,clips ,  live performances and an interview with Ronny Moorings\\n\\n2009, before the release of the actual album the band released digital only singles for \"Heroes\" and \"Emily\" as teasers. In the band’s twenty fifth year, Clan of Xymox presented \"In Love We Trust.\" The stunning opus adroitly combines the early melancholic 4AD sound of the band with the glimmering synthesizer sounds of the 90s and the power of classic darkwave. Past and present were perfectly combined to showcase the music that has kept Clan of Xymox relevant and popular after all this time.\\n\\nWith this release, Clan of Xymox demonstratively returned to its roots while nevertheless remaining up to date. After spending the past two and a half decades forging a path for others to follow in the dark music scene, \"In Love We Trust\" proves above all that their creative potential is a long way from coming to an end.\\n\\nClan of Xymox has become now - a velvet lined room smelling of roses and clove, the distant chime of crystal engaging crystal, and the slow lilting line of smoke forming nameless shapes as it draws you ever in.\\n\\n2011 \" Darkest Hour\" was released, according to poponaut : Ronny Moorings’ passion for huge, sensual melodies, mystical sound experiments and seductive dance rhythms is as unbroken as it ever was. Melancholy, energy and determination rule “Darkest Hour”, a record whose tracks “My Reality” or the hypnotic club hit “Delete” will work on any dancefloor, but that also delivers gripping entertainment and world-class Goth hymns with “Dream Of Fools” or the breathtaking “Wake Up My Darling”. Crowned, as usual, with Ronny’s unmistakable vocals instilling the necessary dark passion into his Dark Wave elegies.\\nEnd December 2011 (USA) and early 2012 in Europe The track \"In Your Arms Again\" from the lastest album \" Darkest Hour\" was included in the David Fincher\\'s film \"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\" starring Daniel Craig & Rooney Mara, a remake of the book by Stieg Larsson.\\n\\nOctober 2012 saw the release of “Kindred Spirits”, true to its title, Ronny Moorings did not exorcise a new CLAN OF XYMOX studio album, but assembled an intimate, strongly biographic collection of cover songs. A time travel back to the artists’ musical idols, influences and soul mates.\\n\\nIn 2014 a  brand new studio album named\" Matters Of Mind, Body And Soul\", was released. The album explores COX\\'s signature, melancholic sound, as evidenced by standout tracks such as “I Close My Eyes” and “Love\\'S On Diet\" or the dark brooding \" The Climate Changed\".\\nCLAN OF XYMOX pull out all the stops and deliver energy, ideas and creativity as if they were about to release their debut album – and not their 15th studio work. „She is Falling in Love“ shines with lost melodies and vibrant electronics as if Ronny Moorings made a song with DEPECHE MODE, „Kiss and Tell“ shyly kisses the Wave era on the cheek before daring a fatal love affair with classic Goth dreaming.\\n„Matters of Mind, Body and Soul“ melts contrasts like these into a coherent, harmonious, passionate album that would have become one of the genre\\'s biggest milestones 20 years ago. Yet, thanks to Ronny Moorings ingenious craft, even today this album manages to reach a goal that has long become unreachable for other contestants of this art form: To deliver a timeless, deeply emotional Gothic record.\\n\\nA worldwide tour followed in 2014 including Australia as well.\\n\\nIn September 2014 , 3 tracks of Clan Of Xymox\\'s first Debut album were taken for a USA released movie \" The Guest\". A soundtrack album will also be released. Among the other artists like Sisters Of Mercy, Love and Rockets & Front 242. The Guest (2014) is an American psychological thriller film, directed and edited by Adam Wingard, and written by Simon Barrett. The film stars Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe, Brendan Meyer and Lance Reddick.\\n\\nClan Of Xymox keeps touring in 2015 and has world wide tour dates announced till the end of 2015 on their home page.\\n\\nCurrent live lineup:\\nRonny Moorings - singer and single songwriter for the band, programming, words, guitar, piano, synths, keyboards, vocals\\nMojca Zugna - bass, vocals\\n Sean Goebel  - keyboards \\nMario Usai - guitar\\n\\nDiscography (as Clan of Xymox):\\n1984 - Subsequent Pleasures (CD)\\n1985 - Clan Of Xymox\\n1986 - Medusa\\n1997 - Hidden Faces\\n1999 - Creatures\\n2000 - Live\\n2001 - Subsequent Pleasures (reissue only CD)\\n2001 - Notes From The Underground\\n2001 - John Peel Sessions\\n2002 - Remixes From The Underground \\n2003 - Farewell\\n2004 - The Best Of Clan Of Xymox\\n2006 - Breaking Point\\t\\n2008 - Visible DVD\\n2009 - In Love We Trust\\n2011 - Darkest Hour\\n2012 - Live at the Castle Party (Audio CD& DVD) Special Issue\\n2012 - Kindred Spirits \\n2014 - Matters Of Mind, Body And Soul \\n\\nAs Xymox:\\n1983 - Subsequent Pleasures (Vinyl, 12\" Limited to 500 copies)\\n1989 - Twist Of Shadows\\n1991 - Phoenix\\n1992 - Metamorphosis\\n1993 - Headclouds\\n1994 - Remix (bootleg) <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Clan+of+Xymox\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Connan Mockasin (born Connan Tant Hosford) is a bubble pop/psychedelic pop musician from Te Awanga, New Zealand.\\n\\nConnan originally started a \"blues-pop\" band whilst living in Wellington, New Zealand, known as Connan and the Mockasins. The group consisted of Connan Hosford (vocals, guitar), Ross Walker (upright acoustic bass) and Seamus Ebbs (drums).\\n\\nIn April–May 2006, the band released their second EP, Uuu It\\'s Teasy, and toured New Zealand to promote the album. They played a fundraising New Zealand show in Wellington on 26 May 2006, before relocating to London on the 30th.\\n\\nAfter a series of concerts in London, the band visited New Zealand again for a national 2006/2007 Summer tour.\\n\\nIn 2007, the band moved from London to a village in East Sussex south of England. Ross Walker was replaced by James Milne, of Lawrence Arabia and Reduction Agents fame, on bass guitar. The band then played the CMJ festival in New York. Towards the end of 2007 Ebbs left the band to pursue his career, shortly before Hosford returned to New Zealand for a national tour in 2008 with a new lineup - becoming a solo act under the name \\'Connan Mockasin\\'.\\n\\nIn 2008, Connan collaborated with Norman Cook (Fatboy Slim) on a song for the upcoming Brighton Port Authority album. He also finished a tour with Pete & The Pirates and set out on a February tour with Late of the Pier. Connan has also collaborated with musicians Liam Finn and Lawrence Arabia. Finn also contributed to their last album. In 2009, Connan Mockasin started touring with befriended band The Veils through Europe, as well as gigs with Liam Finn and Micachu & the Shapes.\\n\\nIn August 2009, Liam Finn performed with a new band called BARB on a small New Zealand tour consisting of Connan Hosford, Lawrence Arabia (James Milne), Eliza Jane Barnes, Seamus Ebbs, Jol Mulholland and Wild Bill Rickets. Their album (recorded at Roundhead Studios in Auckland, New Zealand) is set for release in August 2010.\\n\\nConnan plays a reshaped Stratocaster, similar in looks to a Vox Teardrop.\\n\\nIn 2010 Connan embarked on a UK tour with Crowded House, playing huge theatre-like venues with mostly seated areas. This proved an interesting challenge for Connan and his group as most would consider his music much more alternative or left-field than that of Crowded House, although Connan had expressed an interest in playing to seated crowds in places such as libraries or theatres.\\n\\nConnan supported Mystery Jets at their gig on 8 July at Somerset House in London with a line up consisting of Elroy Finn (brother of Liam Finn) on drums, Wild Bill Rickets on percussion and Nick Harsant on bass. That summer the line up (with occasional guests on guitar and keys) played several festival shows such as Latitude Festival and Offset Festival.\\n\\nIn 2010 Connan supported Warpaint on some of their UK tour dates.\\n\\nIn 2012 Connan supported Radiohead during the Australasian leg of their world tour playing six sell out arena shows, one in Auckland, one in Brisbane and two in Sydney and Melbourne.\\n\\nConnan Mockasin released their first album \"Please Turn Me into the Snat\" in 2010 on Phantasy Sound, Erol Alkan\\'s record label, and in 2011 on Because Music. The album reached No. 39 on the New Zealand album charts,[1] and received glowing reviews from critics including NME and Drowned in Sound. It was also shortlisted for the 2011 Taite Music Prize.\\n\\nOn 28 March 2011 the album was re-released as \"Forever Dolphin Love\" with a live bonus disc on Phantasy and Because Music. Mockasin has received favorable reviews for his unusual sound and musical style.\\n\\nLabel-mate Samuel Dust of Late of the Pier has toured with Connan Mockasin as a backing musician.\\n\\nMockasin and band have been touring with Charlotte Gainsbourg as her live band after Mockasin composed the song \\'Out Of Touch\\' for her latest album Stage Whisper.\\n\\nMockasin toured with Radiohead in Australia and New Zealand throughout November 2012, playing sold out shows in Auckland, Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne.\\n\\nMockasin announced the release of his second album, Caramel, in September 2013. It will be released November 4 via Phantasy Sound/Because Music in the UK and November 5 via Mexican Summer in the US. The artist describes the new record as a concept playing off his last LP, \"It starts with the dolphin leaving, and the boss who is so in with love with the dolphin is sad, and then it kicks into the new album, and he is happier.

       "  'bio': 'There are at least four bands with the name Daddy Long Legs\\n\\n1) Daddy Long Legs were a London three-piece who made wonky and joyfully noisy pop music.\\n\\nThe band comprised of an Englishman on bass (Jay Ballard), a Scotsman on guitar (Al Joseph) and a half-Portugueseman on drums (Chris Rodriguez); who were all equally in charge of singing, hooting, whooping and shouting.\\n\\n2) Daddy Long Legs is a recently formed (April 2010) two-piece acoustic/indie/soul group from Keene, New Hampshire.\\n\\nThe band consists of Dave Grundy and Brian Burgess, both of whom do acoustic guitar and vocals for the band. On October 5th, 2010, Daddy Long Legs released their debut EP, King Of The Blue Charade for free download on their official website.\\n\\n3) Daddy Long Legs is a four piece blues band from Kitchener, Ontario, Canada. \\n\\nThe band is Mike \\'Shakey\\' Elliott, Chris \\'Junior\\' Malleck, Steve Toms and  Jeff Wagner. In 2013 they released their fifth album Devil\\'s In The Detailson Busted Flat Records. They played the Kitchener Blues Festival 2012 & 2013 Facebook https://www.facebook.com/pages/Daddy-Long-Legs/199504549828 \\n\\n4) Daddy Long Legs is a German folk/celtic band. They released one album in 2001 called  2nd Birth.\\n\\n\\n\\nDaddy Long Legs is also a stage musical adaptation of the 1918 novel by Jean Webster.\\n\\nRecord Review\\n\\nDaddy Long Legs, Evil Eye On You (Norton Records)\\nposted by: RZO\\n\\nRecord Review by RZO\\n\\nI’ve seen Brian Hurd emerge from being one of The Visitors—a now defunct garage rock revival band that I loved—to the centerpiece of this dirty Brooklyn blues band.\\n\\nHurd is a larger-than-life persona, and it was obvious that he had to move on and do his own thing. And do his own thing he did. Enter Daddy Long Legs, with his towering, string bean body and wispy afro top, chock full of blues licks and yelps that must have come with him from his native St. Louis.\\n\\nThis isn’t to say New York has nothing to do with it. His partners in crime, drummer Josh Styles, who I remembered from The Stalkers, and Murat Akturk—one of the most convincing Johnnie Thunders pre-nasty heroin downfall guitarists turned blues sliders (and also formerly of The Electric Shadows)—know a good tune or two. And with Daddy Long Legs on harp and vocals, tearing it up, track after track, you’ve got a winner.\\n\\nDaddy Long Leg’s debut on Norton Records, Evil Eye On You, does not disappoint. Although it mostly wallows in the blues, any fan of traditional rock ‘n’ roll will tell you that’s where the magic started anyway. And it’s always nice when an album has a good through line that tells a story. This is the tale of Daddy Long Legs and his mates conjuring up the soundtrack to a rollicking backwoods BBQ.\\n\\nTrack one, “Death Train Blues,” starts with gritty, dirty harp, slide guitar and tambourine. It sounds vintage, as if a repurposed Robert Johnson. “I Feel So Electric” has a nice guitar and stripped down drum opening, while the vocals remind me of “Roadhouse Blues” by The Doors. With “Happy Home,” I hear former garage rock influence by the likes of The Sonics and The Downliners Sect.The guys in action!\\n\\n“Shackin’ Up” is peppier, upbeat, and a little like old Bob Dylan. Whereas Lux Interior from The Cramps can be imagined with “You’ll Be Mine,” including some nice slide work. The center track “Witch Hunt” serves as a bristling conduit to the remaining tracks, veering from snakebite or an exorcism, with nice yelps and harp. The sting continues with “Trouble (Always Come My Ways),” along with hoops, hollers and rowdy crowd jeers. Once it gets going, it takes off with tambourine and full instrumentation. Love the muffled vocal effects.\\n\\n“Sittin’ Shotgun” is mid-tempo, and keeps the album chugging along. The pounding, biting, “Comin’ After Me” (recorded previously by greats like The Flamin’ Groovies and DMZ) has good Stonesy backing vocals and callback harp. I found “Candy Sue” to be a nice reprieve, with groovy, danceable, beats that really got my booty shaking. “Thirty Days” is a lively romp, and I can almost imagine a gaggle of train jumpers singing the refrain. The closer, “Evil Eye,” really seals in the down and dirty swampy feel.\\n\\nGet yer copy at the Norton Records site: http://www.nortonrecords.com/lps_new.php.

He was once in the band, Coolidge, with Seattle\\'s David Bazan.\\n\\nJurado\\'s solo career began during the mid-1990s, releasing lo-fi folk based recordings on his own cassette-only label, Casa Recordings, beginning in 1995. \\n\\nJurado often makes use of found-sound and field-recording techniques, and has experimented with different forms of tape recordings. In 2000 he released Postcards and Audio Letters, a collection of found audio letters and fragments that he had found from sources such as thrift store tape players and answering machines. Also released in 2000 was Ghost of David,, Jurado\\'s bleakest and most personal sounding record to date. I Break Chairs, (2002) was produced by long time friend,  David Bazan. It was his last album for Sub Pop, and was a much rockier, electric affair. After signing for the Indiana-based label Secretly Canadian, Damien Jurado reverted to his trademark folk ballad-based style, releasing six more albums: Where Shall You Take Me?

       " {'name': 'Death Cab for Cutie',\n",
       "  'bio': '\\nDeath Cab for Cutie is an American indie rock band formed in Bellingham, Washington in 1997. The band consists of Ben Gibbard (vocals, guitar, piano), Nicholas Harmer (bass), Jason McGerr (drums), Dave Depper (guitar) and Zac Rae (keyboards).\\n\\nDeath Cab began as a solo project of Ben Gibbard, now the band\\'s vocalist and guitarist. Gibbard took the band name from the satirical song Death Cab for Cutie, performed by The Bonzo Dog Band in The Beatles\\' 1967 experimental film Magical Mystery Tour. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords; the release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the band into a complete project. He recruited Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as an electric guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass guitarist, and Nathan Good to play drums. \\n\\nThe four released the LP Something About Airplanes on August 18th 1998. The album was favorably reviewed in the independent music scene, and in 2000 the band released We Have the Facts and We\\'re Voting Yes. Nathan Good left the band at some point during this album\\'s production. His playing on “The Employment Pages” and “Company Calls Epilogue” were kept, but Gibbard played drums on all other songs.\\n\\nMichael Schorr would first appear on The Forbidden Love E.P., released on October 24, 2000. In 2001, another LP was released, entitled The Photo Album. Limited editions of this album contained three bonus tracks, which were later released separately as The Stability EP.\\n\\nIn 2003, there was another change of drummer, with Jason McGerr of Eureka Farm replacing Schorr. McGerr would play drums on the next release, Transatlanticism.\\n\\nTransatlanticism was released in October of 2003. It received critical praise and also became the band\\'s top-selling album, with 225,000 copies sold during its first year out.\\n\\nIn spring of 2004, the band recorded a live E.P. titled The John Byrd E.P., named for their sound engineer. The E.P. was released on Barsuk Records in March 2004.\\n\\nIn November of 2004, Death Cab for Cutie signed a “long-term worldwide deal” with Atlantic Records, leaving their long-time label Barsuk Records. Gibbard stated on the official website www.deathcabforcutie.com that nothing would change except that “Next to the picture of Barsuk holding a 7\", there will be the letter \"A\" on both the spine and back of our upcoming albums.” This was a marked change from Gibbard\\'s earlier views on major-label relations, which he said “are set up to fuck you and take all your money.”. After signing to Atlantic, the band was still nervous about corporate economics, and encouraged fans to download its songs from the Internet.\\n\\nThe first and second singles off the band\\'s Atlantic Record release Plans were “Soul Meets Body” and “Crooked Teeth”, respectively. The full album was released in August of 2005. Plans was somewhat well-acclaimed by critics and fans, and received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Album of 2005. It achieved Gold Status in 2006 after charting on Billboard for 47 consecutive weeks.\\n\\nThe band released a touring DVD titled Drive Well, Sleep Carefully in 2005. Known for their contributions to animal rights, the band is supporting the activist group PETA in giving away copies of the DVD to promote animal rights.\\n\\nIn early 2006, the band announced the upcoming release of Directions, eleven short films inspired by songs from the Plans album, each directed by a different person. The videos were posted one at a time at the band\\'s website and the DVD went on sale April 11, 2006.\\n\\nOn May 12, 2008 their album, Narrow Stairs, was released  and was well received by both critics and fans. It was their first album to reach #1 on the Billboard 200. The album contains the singles \"I Will Possess Your Heart\", \"Cath...\" and \"Grapevine Fires\".\\n\\nThe band\\'s latest released The Open Door EP, which was released on March 31, 2009. Their main styles consist of slow progressive rock with dark lyrics.\\n\\nThe band\\'s seventh album, Codes and Keys, was released on May 31, 2011. The album\\'s first single was \"You Are A Tourist\".\\n\\nOn October 11, 2013, the band reportedly began working on their eighth studio album. This was then confirmed by the group\\'s official Instagram profile in which an image was uploaded with the caption \"DCFC LP8 begins\". The new album will be produced by Rich Costey and is expected to be released in early 2015. In an interview with Stereogum, Gibbard said of the new album, \"I do think from start to finish it\\'s a much better record than Codes And Keys. If that record turned anybody off, I feel pretty strongly that this one could win them back. There are threads in this one that connect back to our earliest stuff that people love.\" On October 29, 2013, the band released a remastered tenth-anniversary version of their 2003 album Transatlanticism. The new album included a vinyl LP and MP3 download, with demos for all the songs from the album.\\n\\nAs part of the 2014 Record Store Day, the band released its first live album, a vinyl-only double LP recorded during various 2012 tour dates with Magik*Magik Orchestra. Included within the packaging was a code for a digital download of the recording.\\n\\nOn August 13, 2014, after 17 years as a member of Death Cab for Cutie, guitarist and songwriter Chris Walla decided to part ways with the band, with his last performance occurring on September 13, 2014 at the Rifflandia Music Festival in Victoria, British Columbia. Walla states that he plans to \"...continue making music, producing records, and erring on the side of benevolence and beauty whenever possible.\" When asked in an interview about Walla\\'s involvement in the eighth album, McGerr confirmed that Walla \"played on everything and has been involved all the way through, even in the mixing. Even though he\\'s played his last show with us, he\\'s still been involved in everything involving this record.\"\\n\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Death+Cab+for+Cutie\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Drive-By Truckers',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Drive-By Truckers are an alternative country band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1996. Currently, the band consists of  Patterson Hood (vocals, guitar), Mike Cooley (vocals, guitar), David Barbe (bass), John Neff (guitar), Jay Gonzalez (keyboards) and Brad Morgan (drums). Cooley and Hood are the only original members of the band remaining. Among the band\\'s former members are Jason Isbell (vocals, guitar) who left the band in 2007, and Shonna Tucker (bass, vocals) who left the band in 2011.\\n\\nNoteworthy for their three guitars lineup, the \\'Truckers\\' are often associated with the Southern rock movement of the 70s and \"jam\" bands but are too cerebral and irreverent to sit squarely in either genre. Their lyrics often revolve around the working class trying to survive in economically-depressed small towns of the South.\\n\\nCo-founded by Patterson Hood (son of bassist David Hood of the legendary Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section) and longtime friend and musical partner Mike Cooley in Athens, Georgia, in 1996. The two men had played in various other bands including Adam\\'s House Cat which was chosen as a top ten Best Unsigned Band by a Musician contest in the late 1980s.\\n\\nTogether with a revolving group of musicians, Drive-By Truckers put out their first two albums, Gangstabilly (1998) and Pizza Deliverance (1999). Following their second release, the band embarked on a nationwide tour, resulting in a live album called Alabama Ass Whuppin\\' (released in 2000 by Second Heaven Records, re-released in 2002 by Terminus Records). They had an entertaining and informational website long before most bands had begun taking advantage of the internet as a promotional tool, and together with constant touring, they quickly developed a large and dedicated fan base both on and off-line.\\n\\nAfter three years on the road a tight-knit group of musicians emerged and they began work on 2001\\'s Southern Rock Opera. Southern Rock Opera is a double album executed as a song cycle. The album loosely uses the rise and literal fall of Lynyrd Skynyrd as a metaphor for the culture of the American South.\\n\\nSelf released on their own Soul Dump Records on September 12, 2001, Southern Rock Opera, quickly accumulated praise from fans and critics alike, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone. To take advantage of the positive reception, Southern Rock Opera was re-issued by Mercury and Lost Highway Records in July 2002. Soon after, Drive-By Truckers were named Band of the Year by No Depression.\\n\\nBefore they could record a follow-up to Southern Rock Opera, guitarist Rob Malone left and was replaced guitarist and songwriter, Jason Isbell. Originally from Greenhill, Alabama, during his five years with Drive-By Truckers, Isbell contributed a number of significant songs to the albums he worked on. \\n\\nDue to changes at Lost Highway, the Truckers were released from their contract and signed with Austin-based record label New West, for the follow-up to Southern Rock Opera, 2003\\'s  Decoration Day. Like its predecessor, the album received broad praise from fans and critics alike. Although it isn\\'t a concept album, the songs of Decoration Day explore a common theme of hard decisions in the context of marriage, incest, break-ups, revenge, murder, and suicide are major themes.\\n\\nAfter years of producing and playing with Drive-By Truckers, bassist Earl Hicks left the band on December 22, 2003. Hicks was immediately replaced by studio bassist Shonna Tucker, then wife of guitarist Jason Isbell. Tucker had previously guested on Decoration Day playing upright bass on the Cooley-penned track, \"Sounds Better in the Song\".\\n\\nIn 2004, Drive-By Truckers released  The Dirty South. Like Southern Rock Opera, The Dirty South was a concept album. The Dirty South further explored the mythology of the South, with songs focusing on Sam Phillips and the Sun Records crowd, John Henry and his hammer, and a three-song suite about Sheriff Buford Pusser.\\n\\nAfter touring throughout 2004 and 2005, Drive-By Truckers found their way to the Fidelitorium Recording Studio in Forsyth County, North Carolina during late 2005. These recording sessions, once again produced by David Barbe, resulted in the band\\'s seventh LP, A Blessing and a Curse.\\n\\nReleased on April 18, 2006, A Blessing and a Curse showcased Drive-By Truckers\\' ability to branch out into new territory, and can be seen as the band\\'s attempt at shaking labeling by critics, detractors, fans, and followers, particularly the Southern rock label that has haunted the band since Southern Rock Opera. The album sounds less like Skynyrd, and more closely resembles the bare-bones British rock of the early 1970s such as The Rolling Stones and Faces. Tom Petty\\'s influence on the band\\'s sound is more prominent on this album as well.\\n\\nIn 2006, Drive-By Truckers reunited, both on-stage and on-record, with Athens-based pedal steel guitarist, John Neff. Neff first played with the band on their 1998 debut LP, Gangstabilly, and played pedal steel on three subsequent albums, 1999\\'s Pizza Deliverance, and 2003\\'s Decoration Day. Neff was featured heavily on the 2006 release,  A Blessing and a Curse. During the next year, Neff began touring with the band as an unofficial sixth member.\\n\\nOn April 5, 2007 Jason Isbell announced that he was no longer a member of the band. The following day, Patterson Hood confirmed the break on the official site. In his letter to the fans, Hood described the parting of ways as \"amicable\" and expressed the hope that fans would continue to support Drive-By Truckers as well as Jason\\'s solo efforts.

       "  'bio': 'Drive-By Truckers are an alternative country band which formed in Athens, Georgia, United States in 1996. Currently, the band consists of  Patterson Hood (vocals, guitar), Mike Cooley (vocals, guitar), David Barbe (bass), John Neff (guitar), Jay Gonzalez (keyboards) and Brad Morgan (drums). Cooley and Hood are the only original members of the band remaining. Among the band\\'s former members are Jason Isbell (vocals, guitar) who left the band in 2007, and Shonna Tucker (bass, vocals) who left the band in 2011.\\n\\nNoteworthy for their three guitars lineup, the \\'Truckers\\' are often associated with the Southern rock movement of the 70s and \"jam\" bands but are too cerebral and irreverent to sit squarely in either genre. Their lyrics often revolve around the working class trying to survive in economically-depressed small towns of the South.\\n\\nCo-founded by Patterson Hood (son of bassist David Hood of the legendary Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section) and longtime friend and musical partner Mike Cooley in Athens, Georgia, in 1996. The two men had played in various other bands including Adam\\'s House Cat which was chosen as a top ten Best Unsigned Band by a Musician contest in the late 1980s.\\n\\nTogether with a revolving group of musicians, Drive-By Truckers put out their first two albums, Gangstabilly (1998) and Pizza Deliverance (1999). Following their second release, the band embarked on a nationwide tour, resulting in a live album called Alabama Ass Whuppin\\' (released in 2000 by Second Heaven Records, re-released in 2002 by Terminus Records). They had an entertaining and informational website long before most bands had begun taking advantage of the internet as a promotional tool, and together with constant touring, they quickly developed a large and dedicated fan base both on and off-line.\\n\\nAfter three years on the road a tight-knit group of musicians emerged and they began work on 2001\\'s Southern Rock Opera. Southern Rock Opera is a double album executed as a song cycle. The album loosely uses the rise and literal fall of Lynyrd Skynyrd as a metaphor for the culture of the American South.\\n\\nSelf released on their own Soul Dump Records on September 12, 2001, Southern Rock Opera, quickly accumulated praise from fans and critics alike, including a four-star review in Rolling Stone. To take advantage of the positive reception, Southern Rock Opera was re-issued by Mercury and Lost Highway Records in July 2002. Soon after, Drive-By Truckers were named Band of the Year by No Depression.\\n\\nBefore they could record a follow-up to Southern Rock Opera, guitarist Rob Malone left and was replaced guitarist and songwriter, Jason Isbell. Originally from Greenhill, Alabama, during his five years with Drive-By Truckers, Isbell contributed a number of significant songs to the albums he worked on. \\n\\nDue to changes at Lost Highway, the Truckers were released from their contract and signed with Austin-based record label New West, for the follow-up to Southern Rock Opera, 2003\\'s  Decoration Day. Like its predecessor, the album received broad praise from fans and critics alike. Although it isn\\'t a concept album, the songs of Decoration Day explore a common theme of hard decisions in the context of marriage, incest, break-ups, revenge, murder, and suicide are major themes.\\n\\nAfter years of producing and playing with Drive-By Truckers, bassist Earl Hicks left the band on December 22, 2003. Hicks was immediately replaced by studio bassist Shonna Tucker, then wife of guitarist Jason Isbell. Tucker had previously guested on Decoration Day playing upright bass on the Cooley-penned track, \"Sounds Better in the Song\".\\n\\nIn 2004, Drive-By Truckers released  The Dirty South. Like Southern Rock Opera, The Dirty South was a concept album. The Dirty South further explored the mythology of the South, with songs focusing on Sam Phillips and the Sun Records crowd, John Henry and his hammer, and a three-song suite about Sheriff Buford Pusser.\\n\\nAfter touring throughout 2004 and 2005, Drive-By Truckers found their way to the Fidelitorium Recording Studio in Forsyth County, North Carolina during late 2005. These recording sessions, once again produced by David Barbe, resulted in the band\\'s seventh LP, A Blessing and a Curse.\\n\\nReleased on April 18, 2006, A Blessing and a Curse showcased Drive-By Truckers\\' ability to branch out into new territory, and can be seen as the band\\'s attempt at shaking labeling by critics, detractors, fans, and followers, particularly the Southern rock label that has haunted the band since Southern Rock Opera. The album sounds less like Skynyrd, and more closely resembles the bare-bones British rock of the early 1970s such as The Rolling Stones and Faces. Tom Petty\\'s influence on the band\\'s sound is more prominent on this album as well.\\n\\nIn 2006, Drive-By Truckers reunited, both on-stage and on-record, with Athens-based pedal steel guitarist, John Neff. Neff first played with the band on their 1998 debut LP, Gangstabilly, and played pedal steel on three subsequent albums, 1999\\'s Pizza Deliverance, and 2003\\'s Decoration Day. Neff was featured heavily on the 2006 release,  A Blessing and a Curse. During the next year, Neff began touring with the band as an unofficial sixth member.\\n\\nOn April 5, 2007 Jason Isbell announced that he was no longer a member of the band. The following day, Patterson Hood confirmed the break on the official site. In his letter to the fans, Hood described the parting of ways as \"amicable\" and expressed the hope that fans would continue to support Drive-By Truckers as well as Jason\\'s solo efforts.

It consists of Colombina Parra (vocals), Claudius Rieth (bass), Hernan Edwards (guitar) and Octavio Bascuñán (drums). They have released two records, Caida Libre (1996) and Cocodrila (2007).\\n\\nMain page: http://www.last.fm/music/los+Ex\\n\\n2) The Ex is an anarchist band from the Netherlands. They formed in 1979 at the height of the original punk  explosion and have released more than twenty full length albums since. Known as an anarcho-punk band in their first years, in later years they also became known for their musical experiments and numerous collaborations.\\n\\nThe Ex\\'s music has undergone significant evolution over the years from their beginnings as an anarcho-punk band. Founded in 1979 by singer G.W. Sok, guitarist Terrie Hessels, drummer Guert and bassist René, the band debuted with a song titled \"Stupid Americans\" on the Utreg-Punx  vinyl 7\" compilation released by Rock Against records in Rotterdam. The release of their first 7\" All Corpses Smell the Same followed shortly after that, in 1980. Through the decades their music has gradually developed into its current form of highly intricate, experimental punk/post-punk/no wave-inspired work.\\nTom Cora performing with The Ex.\\n\\nBreaking from the relatively narrow confines of punk rock, The Ex have incorporated a wide array of influences, often from non-Western and non-rock sources. Some include Hungarian and Turkish folk songs, and more recently music from Ethiopia, Congo and Eritrea (the independence song of Eritrea is covered by The Ex on Turn). Other examples of branching out stylistically include the improvised double album Instant and a release under the moniker Ex Orkest, a 20 piece big band assembled for performances at Holland Festival.\\n\\nThe band has collaborated succesfully with many disparate artists, including UK anarchist band Chumbawamba (sometimes using the name Antidote), the Dog Faced Hermans (one former member, Andy Moor, currently plays electric guitar in The Ex), and with the late avant-garde cellist Tom Cora in the early 1990s, resulting in the album Scrabbling at the Lock (1991) and the follow-up And the Weathermen Shrug Their Shoulders (1993). The album In the Fishtank 5 (1999) was made with Chicago\\'s Tortoise, and on In the Fishtank 9 (2001) they collaborated with members of Sonic Youth and the Dutch improvisers ICP.\\n\\nBass guitar player Luc left the band in 2003 after 19 years with the group, to be replaced by double bassist Rozemarie.[2] In 2005 Rozemarie in turn left the band.[3] The Ex is the subject of a documentary, Beautiful Frenzy (2004) by Christina Hallström and Mandra U. Wabäck, and the concert film Building a Broken Mousetrap (2006), directed by Jem Cohen.[4]\\n\\nIn 2009, after 30 years with the group, singer and co-founder G.W. Sok announced his departure from the band. Sok did so, believing he lacked sufficient enthusiasm to continue with the group, having decided to focus on writing and graphic design. He plans to continue to \"participate in Ex activities, one way or another\".[5] His replacement is Arnold de Boer from the Dutch group Zea, with whom The Ex have toured and collaborated.

       " {'name': 'Feeder',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Feeder are an award-winning Welsh rock band that formed in Newport, Wales in 1992. By 1995 they released their debut EP Two Colours and a second EP titled Swim, which was followed by their 1997 debut album Polythene, after being met with critical acclaim and made the UK Top 75. Their second album, Yesterday Went Too Soon (1999), again found favour with critics and reached number eight in the UK.With the lead single \"Buck Rogers\" from their 2001 album Echo Park, Feeder entered the mainstream, around a time manufactured pop was frequently dominating the top 10. After their breakthrough year, their drummer Jon Lee committed suicide in his Miami home in January 2002. The band vowed to continue and would then in October 2002 release Comfort in Sound; an album musically and lyrically focused around the band\\'s emotions at the time, and was well-received by critics. Former Skunk Anansie and Little Angels drummer Mark Richardson joined the band in August 2002. Alongside Jon, the band were originally comprised of Grant Nicholas (lead vocals, guitar, piano) and Taka Hirose (bass).\\n\\nThe band have released six studio albums and two compilations, including the platinum-selling singles album. In total they have three platinum albums, two gold albums and one silver in the UK. Their only sales award outside the UK is that of a gold award in the Republic of Ireland for their singles album.\\n\\nAs of December 2006, according to the ranking system in the Guinness Book of British Hit Singles and Albums, Feeder are one of the most successful UK chart acts of all-time based on the combination of single and album chart weeks, as they rank at #500 or above at #457. To date they have twenty-three top 75 singles, and five top 10 albums.\\n\\nFormation\\nAt the age of 14, singer and guitarist Grant Nicholas joined a band called \\'Sweet Leaf\\', named after a Black Sabbath song- the first band Grant had seen play live. At this time bassist Taka Hirose along with drummer Jon Lee, were both playing in different covers bands before they would meet Grant.\\n\\nWhile both playing in different bands on the Newport unsigned gig circuit, Grant and Jon became friends and would take part what was described by the frontman as a \"friendly rivalry\". They decided to train to become sound engineers, but were interested in playing in bands as opposed to recording them. They formed a band called \\'Rain Dancer\\' after Jon left Newport band The Darling Buds during the previous year, the formers sound was described by Grant as that of The Waterboys. However, before then they formed an electronic duo called \\'Temper Temper\\' and like \\'Rain Dancer\\', they failed to work out.\\n\\nGoing back to the drawing board, they formed a three piece band called \\'Reel\\' in which they fired their bass player before changing their name to \\'Real\\'. During this time they recruited Japanese bassist Taka Hirose via an advert in Loot. The band then changed their name to Feeder named after Grant\\'s pet goldfish.\\n\\nThey won their recording contract with Echo after sending a demo tape and then completed the deal after an employee from the label witnessed one of the bands gigs. A track from the demo titled \"Don\\'t Bring Me Down\", appeared as a b-side on the \"Day in Day Out\" single, but uses an electric guitar as opposed to an acoustic as heard on the released version.\\n\\nIn 2006 a demo tape of their early demos surfaced on eBay, selling for £180 pounds. It contains the recording of \"Suffocate\" under the name of \"Give\", alongside an unreleased track titled \"Believe\". \"Give\" is reportedly \"slightly different musically and lyrically\" from that of \"Suffocate\".\\n\\nTwo Colours - Swim (1995-1996)\\nFeeder\\'s first official release was the 2 track Two Colours EP in 1995, which was only available at the bands first gigs. It was limited to 1500 CD\\'s and 1000 7\" vinyls and today is valued at £40-60. In 1996, the band released their first commercially available release the Swim EP, on Echo. The record had six tracks on it with a running time of 22 minutes, with a 2001 re-issue including b-sides and two videos from the era of their debut album proper. The EP was given a 4/5 review in Kerrang! magazine (KKKK).\\n\\nShortly before the record was released, a tape called Two Tracker was given away free with Kerrang! magazine and contained the tracks \"Sweet 16\" and \"Waterfall\", the latter was described in the inlay card as one of the tracks that was on their forthcoming debut album proper then entitled Here In The Bubble (which soon changed it\\'s name to Polythene). Some of the photography for the EP\\'s inlay was produced by Grant himself, while Chris Sheldon produced the album. The band released \"Stereoworld\" from the record as it\\'s only single, after appearing at the Reading festival. The year also seen the band participate in a tour, visiting seaside towns like Newquay.\\n\\nPolythene (1997-1998)\\nAfter building a strong fanbase with the release of Swim, the following year the band released their first full album. The result Polythene is now widely regarded as a classic by Kerrang! magazine readers, as they voted it the 87th best British rock album of all time in a January 2005 issue, and was also Metal Hammer magazine\\'s album of 1997, in which it scored a mark of 10/10 in it\\'s review. Two tracks from \"Swim\" were used for the album with those being \"Descend\" and \"Stereoworld\".\\n\\nAfter the recording sessions were completed, the album\\'s first single \"Tangerine\" was released and charted at #60 in the UK charts. This was followed by \"Cement\" charting at #53 and then the release of the album in which it charted at #65. Two more singles were released either side of their main stage debut at the Reading festival of 1997, with \"Crash\" making #48 and a new song entitled \"High\" charted at #24.\\n\\nThe album as of March 2003, has been certified silver by the BPI for shipments of 60,000 units. They also re-issued the album in October 1997 with \"High\" included and the \"Stereoworld\" b-side \"Change\" replacing \"Waterfall\" from the original tracklist. Also included as an enhanced element was the video for \"High\". The album caused many critics to label the band \"The UK\\'s answer to the Smashing Pumpkins\", and also draw comparisons to The Pixies and also Talk Talk. The bands tour of the album took part in April before the release of the \"Cement\" single, and would also tour after the release of the album. The bands earlier sound on the album was once described by Grant as \"heavy but melodic rock\".\\n\\nIn early 1998, following the band\\'s final 1997 tour in support of Polythene, the band traveled to the USA as a support act for Everclear. During the tour the band released back home in the UK a re-worked version of \"Suffocate\" from their album which charted at #37. After their return to the UK, they played their own headline tour with Everclear this time in the support slot. Later on in the year Feeder then started to play various music festivals in the States, before a tour took place with \"High\" being released to radio stations and charting at #24 on the rock chart as a result, and was the follow up to \"Cement\" which charted at #31. During the first US tour, Grant said he used to get very tired and sometimes couldn\\'t wait to return home to work on the next album. Alongside a broken ankle and other injuries, he also said he used to find it hard to sleep at nights, which inspired him to write \"Insomnia\" which appeared on their second album. They stayed in the US for the majority of the year, with a trip back to the UK for their V98 appearance. It was during their gigs of 1998 they introduced as a live guitarist Dean Tidey who plays at the band\\'s gigs, and has his own band called the Sandstone Veterans. Grant said in a 1998 interview in Kerrang!, that he was considering bringing in another guitarist for their live gigs. Polythene sold 25,000 copies in the States during 1998.\\n\\nYesterday Went Too Soon (1999)\\nFor 1999\\'s \"Yesterday Went Too Soon\", the band decided to self-produce the album and brought in Matt Sime for engineering duties, while the album was mixed in New York by Andy Wallace. \"Dry\" was re-recorded as a full band version after the original acoustic version appeared on \"Suffocate\" as a b-side. That single\\'s b-sides featured tracks from their sessions for the album, and therefore gave an idea on how this album was going to sound. The working title for the album was originally A Life Through Headphones, and was originally planned to be a double album. The name change was due to former Take That singer Robbie Williams releasing his solo debut album Life Thru a Lens, and did not want to be associated with him.\\n\\nWhen the album was released, the bands awareness raised and it would enter the UK charts at #8. Before then the band released the albums first single \"Day in Day Out\" in March 1999 which charted at #31, which was followed by \"Insomnia\" at #22 and was their first appearance on TOTP. A week before the band played once again the main stage at the Reading/Leeds festival, the title track from the album charted at #20 and the album was then released on August 30, 1999. Only one single was lifted from the album afters, in which a re-recorded version of \"Paperfaces\" charted at #41.\\n\\nSome of the album\\'s lyrical themes were that of Grant writing from a persons perspective of working daily in a menial supermarket job (\"Day In Day Out\"), his experiences after gigs on their US tour (\"Insomnia\"), relationships ending (the title track and \"Dry\"), journeys back to Wales via the M4 (\"Hole in My Head\"), relationships (\"You\\'re My Evergreen\" and \"Anasetic\") amongst others. Musically the album employed an indie rock feel to it which also featured extended appearances of an acoustic guitar on some of its tracks.\\n\\nPrior to the album\\'s release it was delayed from June to August, which was due to Grant writing material after it was originally completed that they felt was too good to leave off the album, and was then included. When it got it\\'s release the UK music press immediately warmed to the album, in which Rob Fitzpatrick then of Melody Maker citing \"An absolute stormer it is. unmissable. absolutely\", and also receiving the magazine\\'s \"Album of the Week\" accolade, with Metal Hammer awarding the album a 10/10 mark. The year ended with a support slot at the Millennium Stadium supporting the Manic Street Preachers, and also before that Red Hot Chili Peppers at Wembley Arena shortly before the \"Paperfaces\" release. As of March 2003, the album has gone gold shipping 100,000 units in the UK.\\n\\nEcho Park (2000-2001)\\nThe following year, Feeder spent most of 2000 at Great Lindford Manor studios writing and recording for their next album. During the year the band also played festivals around the country previewing the new material they were working on, such as V2000 and Glastonbury, but would end the year promoting \"Buck Rogers\"- their first single since November 1999, and then playing a mini-tour at the end of the year to mainly showcase the new material. The same night the band played the Leeds Cockpit in December 2000, they were told earlier on in the day that their new single has made the radio 1 A-list, meaning the single would be given a high degree of airplay rotation. The release of the single on January 8 2001 was coupled with a signing session at London\\'s now closed Tower Records store, and then TV appearances on Top of The Pops and The Pepsi Chart Show due to the singles midweek performance. This seen the band become forced to cancel two signing sessions as a result. The single charted at #5 becoming the bands first top 10 entry in that chart. In South Africa, the track reached #1 on the 5FM top 40 and would headline a one-day event celebrating the station\\'s 26th birthday.\\n\\nIn relation to the public reaction to \"Buck Rogers\", Grant was asked in an April 2001 edition of a Feederweb fanzine if he felt under pressure to deliver another radio-friendly song, in reply he said:- \"Not really, I think with the radio thing you have to be really careful; at the end of the day Feeder\\'s not a typical daytime radio band, but what we\\'ve done is that we\\'ve proved that a guitar band - a British guitar band, and a band that doesn\\'t have the profile of U2 or someone can still get into the top ten. It is possible!, it just seems to be that it\\'s always the big American bands who sort of dominate the top ten; a Limp Bizkit or whatever, but saying that I think the whole Travis and Coldplay thing has been really good as sort of a stepping stone, and also I think people are getting fed up of just seeing Westlife or Steps on the TV. I think people are finding rock, and real bands again - I think that the market is currently so bombarded with pop stuff that we\\'re just quite refreshing. Rock never went away, but it never really got the exposure. Hopefully It\\'ll get \"Seven Days in the Sun\" away…\".\\n\\nGrant once said that the song is about a relationship ending but also uses humour, with the name for the song originating from a keyboard piece Grant created which sounded \"futuristic\", and named it \"Buck Rogers\". In a 2005 interview in Q Magazine he said of the song- \"It\\'s funny, I don\\'t even particularly like that song, I\\'ve always thought I was a pretty dark songwriter, and what do I finally get known for?. A throwaway pop song. But I really shouldn\\'t complain, should I?. If it wasn\\'t for \"Buck Rogers\", I probably wouldn\\'t be here talking to you now\". Grant wrote the track for an American band called \\'Radio Star\\', but was convinced by producer Gil Norton not to give the song away as he felt Feeder themselves could have a hit with it. The single appears in many all-time lists generated by XFM and Kerrang!, with a 2004 peak of #25 in the annual XFM list. \"Buck Rogers\" is featured on the soundtrack of the 2001 film Behind Enemy Lines starring Owen Wilson.\\n\\nAfter a sell-out tour of two legs, ending at the London Astoria the said album Echo Park entered and peaked at #5 in the UK album charts, and reached gold sales status. A third single \"Turn\" reached #27, before festival season in which the band played the main stages of Reading/Leeds and also T in the Park. \"Just a Day\" a b-side from \"Seven Days in the Sun\" reached #12.\\n\\nThe album saw the band take on much more of a commercially influenced sound, and also the appearance of Moog synthesizers, while being lyrically focused on a comedy approach like with \"Seven Days in the Sun\", but also dark emotions such as those shown on \"Turn\", \"Oxygen\" and \"Satellite News\". It was during the campaign for Echo Park, that the band played another slot on the main stage at the Reading/Leeds festival. As of March 2003, the album has shipped 300,000 units in the UK, going platinum.\\n\\nGrant said in a Melody Maker interview that if the album didn\\'t sell the band would probably split up, in which he said at the time \"It\\'s the same with any band. That\\'s just the way the music business is. There is only a certain amount of money a label will put into a band. I\\'m just being realistic. We\\'ve been around for seven or eight years and I am not planning on giving up, but we\\'re putting everything into this record and I\\'m just hoping that people like it\". The album was voted the 25th best British rock album of all-time by Kerrang! readers, and was the highest placed Feeder album in the list. On August 28, 2001 the band won \"Best British Live Act\" at the 2001 Kerrang! awards, and would end the year supporting the Stereophonics before releasing \"Just a Day\".\\n\\nComfort In Sound (2002-2003)\\nThe following year their drummer, Jon Lee, took his own life in his Miami home, meaning that the band kept out of the public eye for most of the following year. Grant started to write songs regarding his feelings at the time and these songs would form the bands fourth album Comfort in Sound. The band drafted in former Skunk Anansie and Little Angels member Mark Richardson for drum duties. The album focused mainly on themes such as loss, depression, grievance, and positivity while dedicating \"Quickfade\" to Jon. The album was released in October of the same year to widespread critical acclaim in the British music press with Kerrang! stating \"Comfort in Sound harnesses the anthmetic appeal of a latter day U2 … and a quality that propels Feeder from the confines of the everyday into the neighbourhood of everyman …\" and giving the album their \"Album of the Week\" award, alongside the heavy rock magazine Metal Hammer giving the album the similar accolade of \"Album of the Month\" while citing \"an album they should rightfully be proud of … \". The band decided to play at the Reading/Leeds festivals that year, making a low-key appearance by playing the second stage. Comfort in Sound was voted by Kerrang! readers as one of their top 100 British rock albums of all-time at #32.\\n\\nMusically, the album was much more mellow with the use of a string orchestra on \"Forget About Tomorrow\". Other tracks on the album also used an accordion, trumpet and a piano played by their manager Matt Page, with \"Godzilla\" being one of two tracks on the album to use loud guitars. This caused many fans to say it didn\\'t fit in with the main feel of the album, with Feeder Fan Site suggesting \"As a package CIS is almost as well formed as Yesterday Went Too Soon. The playlist is spot on (Godzilla being the only track that sits, not entirely sure if it really belongs)\". The album was their first to receive a platinum sales award, (with Echo Park going platinum later on). It also spawned their second top 10 single with \"Just the Way I\\'m Feeling\" in January 2003 and is seen by Grant as the single that made the album successful, once saying- \"It’s one of the best songs I’ve done, but we nearly didn’t do it. I wrote it right at the end of making Comfort in Sound, and our producer Gil Norton said he wasn’t sure we really needed another mid tempo song. But when we played it, we all thought that it definitely did have something. Lyrically it’s quite dark but it’s still an uplifting song. This was the single that really made the album a success. It’s the kind of song I’d like us to be remembered for\". In December of the same year they took on their first and only arena tour to date, after the albums first tour sold all of its 60,000 tickets.\\n\\nThe album\\'s final single wasn\\'t available to buy commercially but was limited to 3,000 CD copies on their 2003 arena tour, Four singles were released commercially with those being \"Come Back Around\" (#14), \"Just The Way I\\'m Feeling\" (#10), \"Forget About Tomorrow\" (#12) and \"Find the Colour\" (#24) which was released after their V2004 appearance and Kerrang! award win for \"Best British Band\", in which Grant dedicated the award to Jon saying it was the award he always wanted the band to win.\\n\\nPushing The Senses (2004-2005)\\nFeeder returned to the studio to record their fifth album. The album was seen by Grant as more of an extension to \"Comfort in Sound\", as it focused on the same lyrical themes and musical styles, with Grant Nicholas also saying that it had more of an organic sound, and more upbeat tracks added into the mix. It also seen a number of piano driven tracks, with \"Frequency\" being an example. \"Frequency\" was produced by Coldplay producer Ken Nelson. For the rest of the album, Gil Norton was on production duties.\\n\\nAs a result, 2005\\'s Pushing the Senses received criticism from long time fans and critics, although the album was Feeder\\'s highest charting release at #2 on the UK album chart, received a gold certification, and created their third top 10 and second top 5 single (\"Tumble and Fall\"). Press response to the album was mixed with Paul Brannigan of Q Magazine citing the album as \"An album that could finally establish Feeder as major league players\", and Chris Heath of Dotmusic dismissing the album saying \"Pushing the Senses is by no means soppy, but Feeder\\'s young fanbase might need some convincing\". Kerrang!\\'s review was seen as unfair in which Grant told Kerrang! radio:- \"You know, being like brutally honest with you I was a bit p*ssed off with the Kerrang! review. I thought it was a very unfair review, and reviewed by the wrong person. If a different journalist had done it, we might have had a great review. I only cared about it as it was a magazine we\\'ve been with for a very long time\".\\n\\nThe album helped them win a headline slot at the Download Festival, shortly before supporting U2 for a brief period on their Vertigo tour, which was followed by an appearance at the Live 8 concert in Edinburgh. The album in total spawned four UK top 40 singles, which included \"Shatter\"- a reworked version of the original track that was a double A-side with \"Tender\". Other singles, apart from the top 5 hit \"Tumble and Fall\" included \"Feeling A Moment\" (#13) and \"Pushing The Senses\" (#30). \"Tender\" and \"Shatter\" both featured on the European release of the Russian film Night Watch, with the latter getting fanbase attention after appearing as a b-side on \"Tumble and Fall\" and a successful petition followed to see its release as a single in its own right.\\n\\nIn September 2005, Grant Nicholas was misquoted in an interview that the band were set to split, which caused the rumour to be reported on music television and radio. The bands website soon denied the claims made in an official statement that read \"Contrary to inaccurate reports in the press and on the radio, Feeder are not recording their last album, nor set to split. An over-enthusiastic reporter seems to have put 2 and 2 together and come up with 43. Indeed the group are looking forward to the release of new single \"Shatter\"/\"Tender\" in October and a Far East and UK tour in November. They have already started writing new material for a Singles Album to be released in the New Year and a further studio album to follow the current album Pushing the Senses\". Soon later in a Kerrang! interview, Grant said that the interviewer misquoted him, and that he said the next album would be Feeder\\'s last album on their current deal with Echo, before deciding to either re-sign or look for a new label.\\n\\nFeeder would end the year seeing their then latest album appear at #39 on Q Magazine\\'s end of year list, and win an award for the album at the Pop Factory Awards in Wales. However the day before, they postponed a winter tour after Grant picked up bleeds on his vocal chords.\\n\\nThe Singles (2006-2007)\\nThe following year in 2006 Feeder returned to the studio with this time Stephen Street working as the bands producer, to record three new tracks to appear on their then forthcoming singles collection The Singles. \"Lost and Found\" (which Grant described as \"an urban love song\") became the first single to promote the collection, and would reach #12 in the UK singles chart in May 2006, after completing their delayed winter tour. The Singles, released in the same month of \"Lost and Found\" was the first Feeder album to have involvement from a major label, with EMI talking part in a one-off collaboration with Echo as the albums distributor. The album reached #2 on the UK albums chart, and was certified platinum in under three months including a gold certification in Ireland. Save Us was the second and final single from the album charting at #34 in late July. A version of the album included a DVD of all their videos filmed up to that point, and extensive sleevenotes by Ben Johncock- a freelance author and writer. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Feeder\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

This style has been described as \"Rock meets PowerBook\". Rolling Stone described him as \"the most pictorial composer-programmer in laptop electronica\".\\n\\nHis oeuvre is far broader though - Hotel Paral.lel won the Prix Ars Electronica Award of Distinction for Digital Musics in 1999 along with Pita\\'s Seven Tons For Free.\\n\\nFennesz has been recording with Ryuichi Sakamoto, with whom he also plays live, with Keith Rowe, Sparklehorse, Mike Patton, etc... He has also worked alongside Peter Rehberg and Jim O\\'Rourke in the improvisional trio Fenn O\\'Berg, and with David Sylvian who sang on his album Venice and for whom Fennesz composed the music for the song \"A Fire in the Forest\" for his album Blemish.\\n\\nIn November 2008, Christian Fennesz released a new album: Black Sea on the Touch Label. In 2009 Fennesz teamed up with Mark Linkous (Sparklehorse) to create In The Fishtank 15. The following year Fennesz released Szampler, a cassette containing his sample collection on the Tapeworm label. This release was later remixed by Stefan Goldmann and released as Goldmann vs. Fennesz: Remiksz.\\n\\nIn November 2013, Fennesz played the final holiday camp edition of the world famous All Tomorrow\\'s Parties festival in Camber Sands, England. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Fennesz\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Guided by Voices',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Guided by Voices is an indie rock band formed in Dayton, Ohio, United States in 1983. The band\\'s lineup has changed several times throughout the band\\'s history, with its only constant member being singer/songwriter Robert Pollard. The band\\'s current lineup consists of Robert Pollard (vocals, guitar), Bobby Bare Jr. (guitar), Doug Gillard (guitar), Mark Shue (bass) and Kevin March (drums). The band\\'s 26th and most recent album, Zeppelin Over China, was released on February 1, 2019.\\n\\nNoted at first for its lo-fi aesthetic and typically Portastudio four-tracks-to-cassette production methods, Guided by Voices\\' music revealed influences from post-British Invasion garage rock, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, punk rock and post-punk. The band also garnered much attention for its prolific output, with a seemingly endless stream of releases. Most songs are in the two-minute range, but many are even shorter; often they end abruptly or are intertwined with odd and homemade sound effects.\\n\\nFormed in Dayton, Ohio in the early 1980s, Guided by Voices began their career as a bar band working the local scene. As lineups and day-jobs shifted, however, Pollard moved the band towards a studio-only orientation. Guided by Voices\\' recording career began with a stream of self-financed, independent releases. With only a few hundred copies of each album being pressed, these tended to circulate only among the band members\\' family and friends.\\n\\nWith the release of the ultra-limited album Propeller in 1992 (of which only 500 copies were pressed, each with a unique, handmade cover), Guided by Voices for the first time gained some recognition outside of their hometown. This was due in part to gaining fans in the college rock circuit and bands such as Sonic Youth, R.E.M. and The Breeders. New York City and Philadelphia were host to Guided by Voices\\' return to the live stage (and first shows outside of Ohio) in 1993. At this time, the always-fluid Guided by Voices lineup coalesced around the core of Pollard, guitarists Tobin Sprout and Mitch Mitchell (not to be confused with Jimi Hendrix\\'s drummer), bassist Dan Toohey, and drummer Kevin Fennell. Sprout, who was briefly featured in an early-\\'80s version of the band, had re-joined circa Propeller and soon became Pollard\\'s primary musical foil, in addition to contributing several of his own songs to the band\\'s catalog. 1993 also saw the release of Vampire on Titus, as well as the Fast Japanese Spin Cycle and Static Airplane Jive EPs. Over the next year, the band began to receive national media exposure from sources such as Spin magazine.\\n\\nIn 1994, after culling both new songs and reams of archival recordings from GBV\\'s history, Pollard delivered the indie landmark Bee Thousand via Scat Records, with a distribution deal through indie label Matador Records. Soon, the band officially signed with Matador, concurrent with Pollard and his bandmates finally retiring from their day jobs to work in music full-time. The band surprised early audiences accustomed to the generally shambling, lo-fi and collage-like quality of the records with their energetic live show, featuring Pollard\\'s homegrown rock theatrics (consisting of karate-kicks, leaps, and Roger Daltrey-inspired mic-twirling), Mitch Mitchell\\'s windmilling and chain smoking, sometime bassist Greg Demos\\' striped pants, a never-ending barrage of tunes that all seemed to clock in under 90 seconds, and prodigious alcohol consumption all around.\\n\\nTheir true Matador debut came in 1995 with Alien Lanes, which, despite a five-figure recording allowance, was constructed out of home-recorded snippets on the cheap. The band\\'s underground following continued to grow, with notices coming from mainstream sources such as MTV and Rolling Stone. After sessions for a concept album entitled The Power of Suck were aborted, the band assembled Under the Bushes Under the Stars out of their first 24-track studio sessions, recorded with Kim Deal and Steve Albini among others, in 1996. However, the strain of heavy touring would ultimately lead to the demise of the \"classic lineup\", with Sprout deciding to retire from the road in order to focus on raising his first child, his painting, and his solo musical career. Sprout and Pollard marked the occasion by releasing simultaneous solo albums on the same day in 1996: Sprout\\'s Carnival Boy and Pollard\\'s Not in My Airforce, with each making a guest appearance on the other\\'s album. Pollard maintained an active, parallel solo and side project career alongside GBV releases for the remainder of that band\\'s existence. These records were primarily self-released. Because GBV alumni were regularly featured, and songs from these albums were frequently included in GBV setlists, they are informally considered to be part of the GBV canon. Also in 1995, the band contributed the song \"Sensational Gravity Boy\" to the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization.\\n\\nPollard created a new incarnation of Guided by Voices with Cleveland glam rockers Cobra Verde in 1997. The following album Mag Earwhig!, combined a new hard-rocking swagger with classic lo-fi fragments and one track, \"Jane of the Waking Universe\", that featured the classic lineup for one last time. However, after another year of rigorous touring, the \"Guided by Verde\" lineup split in late 1997 following Pollard\\'s announcement in an interview that he intended to work with other musicians on the next Guided by Voices project.\\n\\nCobra Verde\\'s Doug Gillard was tapped for yet another new Guided by Voices lineup in 1998, which also included \"classic\"-era bassist Greg Demos, former Breeders drummer Jim Macpherson, and eventually, former Amps/Breeders guitarist Nate Farley. Departing from Matador, this lineup (without Farley) worked with producer Ric Ocasek to create what was intended to be Guided by Voices\\' major label debut. Initially produced for Capitol Records, Do the Collapse was repeatedly delayed and finally released in mid-1999 on pseudo-indie label TVT. (In the UK it was released on Creation Records). Featuring a slick, heavily processed sound previously foreign to GBV albums, Do the Collapse failed to catch on at radio, and was for the most part greeted with mixed reviews.\\n\\nThrough touring heavily throughout 1999 and 2000, Guided by Voices\\' live act became legendary, with shows often stretching past the three-hour mark, and populated by an endless stream of new and classic songs, Pollard solo tracks, impromptu covers of The Who, David Bowie and The Rolling Stones, all accompanied by continuous alcohol consumption. In addition to multiple swings through the United States and Europe, 2000 saw the band\\'s first and only visits to Australia and Japan. 2000 was capped with the release of the massive Suitcase, a four-disc, 100-song trawl through three decades worth of Pollard\\'s enormous reserve of unreleased material. (Two more box sets of unreleased songs, Suitcase 2 and Suitcase 3, were released in October 2005 and November 2009, respectively.)\\n\\n2001\\'s Isolation Drills was recorded with Rob Schnapf, who aimed to capture the band\\'s live sound more closely than did Ocasek. Though the album debuted in Billboard\\'s top 200 and received higher critical notices than its predecessor, it did not achieve the sought-after radio breakthrough.\\n\\nAfter departing from TVT in 2002, Guided by Voices returned to Matador and released Universal Truths and Cycles, a departure from the previous two radio-aspiring albums, and a return to the band\\'s mid-90\\'s, mid-fi aesthetic. Universal Truths producer Todd Tobias would also record the band\\'s final two albums for Matador. 2003 saw the release of the prog-styled Earthquake Glue, followed by the anthology box set Hardcore UFOs: Revelations, Epiphanies and Fast Food in the Western Hemisphere and the greatest hits compilation Best of Guided by Voices: Human Amusements at Hourly Rates.\\n\\nIn 2004, Pollard announced he was disbanding Guided by Voices following the release of the Half-Smiles of the Decomposed LP, and a final farewell tour. \\n\\nOn November 9, 2004 Guided by Voices performed on the stage of Austin City Limits, broadcast by PBS on January 22, 2005. Their last television appearance was on Late Night with Conan O\\'Brien on December 2, 2004. They played the single, \"Everybody Thinks I\\'m a Raincloud (When I\\'m Not Looking)\". After a select round of final US shows, Guided by Voices played their final show at The Metro in Chicago on December 31, 2004. The four hour, 63-song marathon finale is documented on the DVD The Electrifying Conclusion\\n\\nIn June 2010, Matador Records announced that the \"Classic \\'93-\\'96 Lineup\" of Robert Pollard (vocals, guitar), Tobin Sprout (guitar), Mitch Mitchell (guitar), Greg Demos (bass) and Kevin Fennell (drums) would reunite to perform at the label\\'s 21st Anniversary celebration in Las Vegas, in October of that year. A full reunion tour was subsequently announced, with the band selling out nearly every date. The tour included stops at Hoboken\\'s Maxwell\\'s and the Southgate House in Newport, Kentucky, two venues that the band had built a history with due to legendary shows there in the past. When asked by Spinner if there might ever be another proper GBV record Pollard said \"I\\'ve thought about it sometimes but it\\'s a very long shot,\" he says. \"We all kind of do our own thing. I\\'m not completely eliminating the possibility.\"\\n\\nThe band played their \"last ever\" performance at North Carolina\\'s Hopscotch Music Festival in September 2011, however later that month the band announced that they would be releasing a new album, Let\\'s Go Eat the Factory on 1 January 2012. The band released a second post-reformation LP, Class Clown Spots a UFO, on June 12, 2012. A third, The Bears for Lunch, followed in November. Another album, English Little League, was released in 2013. In a July 2013 interview with Magnet Magazine, Pollard stated that English Little League could be the final GBV album. However, in September, a fifth reunion record, Motivational Jumpsuit, was confirmed for release on Guided By Voices Inc. and Fire Records in February 2014. A sixth reunion album, Cool Planet, has also been announced for May 19, 2014.\\n\\nIn 2016, Guided by Voices (lineup at the time only Robert Pollard) released their 22nd album, Please Be Honest. Pollard played every instrument on the album.\\n\\nOn April 7, 2017, the band, with another new lineup, released their 23rd album, August by Cake. The first double album by the band, it contains songs written and sung by other band members besides Robert Pollard. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Guided+by+Voices\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Hinder',\n",
       "  'bio': '1) Hinder is a hard rock group inspired by post-grunge music that was formed in Oklahoma City in July 2001 when guitarist Joe Garvey and drummer Cody Hanson discovered Austin Winkler singing for a cover band at a college dorm party. \"I heard him and was blown away,\" said Cody. \"He has the kind of charisma very few people have and that unique voice. You can\\'t really compare him to anybody.\" Hinder\\'s perhaps best known for their number one smash \"Lips Of An Angel\".\\n\\nThe band is notably influenced both by 90s post-grunge as well as by 80s dirty hard rock and glam metal, with several critics noting their debt to Guns n\\' Roses. Cut to almost five years later after Winkler met the guys, and Hinder built a healthy regional following. They released an independent album, titled \\'Far From Close\\', which sold out several thousands of copies. The band was the object of an honest-to-goodness bidding war between three different major labels that resulted in its major label debut, titled \\'Extreme Behavior\\', coming out to much commercial success in 2005.\\n\\nTrue to the group\\'s origins in Austin Winkler\\'s cover band, Hinder has released several covers of songs that have inspired the band. Examples include \"Bed of Roses\" (by Bon Jovi), \"Born to be Wild\" (by Steppenwolf), \"Take Me Home Tonight\" (by Eddie Money), and \"Thunderstruck\" (by AC/DC). Their debut album included the huge hit (and perhaps their best known original song) \"Lips Of An Angel\", and said album has been triple-platinum certified by the RIAA.\\n\\nAlthough receiving mixed to negative critical reviews for \\'Extreme Behavior\\', setting up a pattern for them as being critical whipping boys, \"Lips of an Angel\" was a rock smash. It topped both the Top 40 Pop Radio Chart and the Digital Download Chart, also putting the group on the top of multiple radio, video and digital charts including Yahoo, iTunes, and MSN. Facing near impossible expectations put on them, with rambunctious live performances stoking the flames, Hinder\\'s sophomore album, \\'Take It To The Limit\\', proved somewhat of a commercial disappointment by comparison. However, the group still moved hundreds of thousands of records and featured a strong glam metal-esque sound that many fans loved.\\n\\nThe band was inducted into the Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame in 2007. After the release of \\'Take It To The Limit\\' in 2008 and \\'All American Nightmare\\' in 2010, though, issues between frontman Winkler and the rest of the band had taken their toll. Finally, on November 20, 2013, it was announced via Loudwire that the band had parted ways with Winkler, the statement saying that there was no animosity towards him but that they just felt it was time to move on. The former Hinder singer has had struggles placing him in rehab before. Saving Abel’s Jared Weeks has often played with the re-jiggered group, and their future is somewhat uncertain though with more studio material promised as of early 2015 (with ex-producer Marshal Dutton being their current singer).\\n\\nAlbums\\n\\'Far From Close\\' (2003)\\n\\'Extreme Behavior\\' (2005)\\n\\'Take It To The Limit\\' (2008)\\n\\'All American Nightmare\\' (2010)\\n\\'Welcome to the Freakshow\\' (2012)\\n\\'When the Smoke Clears\\' (2015)\\n\\n2) Hinder is a Black Metal band from Netherlands.

Whether an act or not, IAMX’s music is primarily concerned with subjects such as outlandish sex, death, narcotic intoxication, bisexuality, obsession, alienation and vague allusions to politics.\\n\\nWith the European marketplace going crazy for his blend of dramatic synth-rock, darkness-infused pop, and intricately-constructed indie dance, IAMX, originally from the Middlesbrough, United Kingdom but currently based in Los Angeles, has been headlining festivals in Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Poland, Ukraine etc. and sharing the stage with Placebo, Franz Ferdinand, and The Cardigans among others.\\n\\nLike an 80s electro glam soundtrack to a Jan Švankmajer film or an almost unfathomable hybrid between the sexy swagger of Prince and the cool and collected respectability of Roxy Music, IAMX mixes Chris’ erotically-charged vocals with music that is, at once, frantic yet controlled.\\n\\nWith such strikingly cinematic songs as the waltzy drama of \"President\" to the percussive sexual predatory dirtiness of \"The Negative Sex\" to the indelibly infectious synthpop of the sweeping \"Spit It Out\", The Alternative is exactly just that - the alternative to the cookie-cutter music scene that dominates the airwaves. Considering the rabid reception he receives from his performances, it seems it\\'s time for the masses to grasp The Alternative.\\n\\nThe beginning of 2011 have witnessed the newest IAMX effort, Volatile Times.

She broke into the public eye with a live solo performance of her song \"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\" on Later... with Jools Holland. She has enjoyed commercial and critical success since, picking up three nominations before winning a BRIT Award, and a Grammy Award nomination. She is also the recipient of an Ivor Novello Award.\\n\\nRecording and performing career\\n\\nShe started her career in 2000. Throughout her twenties, she played in indie bands including Elia Drew and Tomoko, and focused on songwriting, as well as performing with members of the fledgling Fence Collective including work in the Skuobhie Dubh Orchestra with King Creosote, who recently supported her UK tour. She also lived with Gordon Anderson (The Beta Band and The Aliens), whom the song Funnyman, on the album Drastic Fantastic, is about. She toured with the Klezmer band Oi Va Voi, and guested on their album, Laughter Through Tears.\\n\\nMusic career\\n\\nEye to the Telescope (2004–2006)\\n\\nHer debut album, Eye to the Telescope, was released in late 2004. Tunstall\\'s style of music varies from folk to pop. In Edinburgh and St Andrews, she played in a band called Red Light Stylus, which was regarded as one of the better bands to emerge from the limited Fife scene.\\n\\nTunstall\\'s first appearance of note was a solo performance of her famed blues song \"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\" on Later... with Jools Holland.[10] The performance was notable as she had only 24 hours to prepare after scheduled performer Nas cancelled. Her performance caught the eye of many viewers, although she had previously performed it on French television only some weeks before, upstaging more established acts such as The Cure, Embrace, and The Futureheads; she then went on to top the post-show poll on the website for that episode.\\n\\nShortly after the \"Later\" appearance, Eye to the Telescope was re-released and shot up the UK charts, eventually peaking at #3 (on its first release it had entered at #73); it was nominated for the 2005 Mercury Music Prize. It was released in the U.S. on 7 February 2006.\\n\\nTunstall\\'s North American break came when American Idol contestant Katharine McPhee contacted her asking to use \"Black Horse and the Cherry Tree\" as her choice for a Billboard-themed week. At the time, the song was #79 on the Billboard charts. Tunstall had not been shy with her opinions regarding shows like Idol saying \"The major problem I have is that it\\'s completely controlled... they\\'re told what to say. They\\'re told how to sing.\" She chose to license the song as she felt that \"no one on that show told Katharine McPhee to sing my song because no one knew it\" Tunstall\\'s belief was correct—the song was suggested to McPhee by Billboard columnist and author Fred Bronson. The song immediately jumped to #23 on the Billboard charts the week following McPhee\\'s performance. She has later said \"My status as a musician in America is pretty much cemented by Katharine McPhee, which is really interesting and funny for me because I\\'ve never been polite about how I feel about shows like that.\"\\n\\nKT Tunstall\\'s Acoustic Extravaganza (2006–2007)\\n\\nTunstall released a new acoustic album in May 2006, KT Tunstall\\'s Acoustic Extravaganza, which was first only available via mail order from her website.

In its first week, Drastic Fantastic reached #1 on the Scottish Album Charts, #3 on the UK Charts, and #9 on the U.S. Charts. The album\\'s lead single \"Hold On\" was released in August 2007, debuting at #34 in the UK, before peaking at #21 in the United Kingdom. The song was also very successful in certain European nations peaking at #19 in Italy, #19 in Norway, #26 in Switzerland and #39 in Ireland. The album\\'s second single \"Saving My Face\" was released in December 2007. The song did not make the UK Top 40 Singles Charts, but however did managed to peak at #50 on the UK Singles Charts, managing 3 weeks on the UK Charts. Despite missing the UK Top 40, the song made the Top 40 in Italy, making #23 and in Switzerland peaking at #93. The album\\'s third single, and final worldwide single, \"If Only\" was released in March 2008, becoming the second single from the album not to make the UK Top 40, it managed #45 in audition.\\n\\nOn 5 October 2007 the U.S. discount department store chain Target, in association with NBC, released a special KT Tunstall Christmas EP on CD.

She also discusses various issues concerning our culture of consumption and greed, our relation to the earth and the importance of indigenous rights in the world today.\\n\\nTunstall also worked with Suzanne Vega on her 2007 album Beauty & Crime, singing backup on songs \"Zephyr and I\" and \"Frank and Ava\".

Nicolas Chassagne, Benoît Poher, and brothers Florian Dubos and Fabien Dubos had already made a splash with their self-titled début in 2000, but it was the textured, slightly electronicized pop of \"Le Chemin\" -- a duet with Dutch songstress Sita -- that really established their slick, Depeche Mode-meets-BBMak sound. \\n\\n2)Solo artist: 京 (Kyo) is a current member of Dir en grey, has also released his own solo work, accompanied by books of his poems.\\n\\n3)Solo artist: Another Kyo is a prominent figure of the Japanese rock scene.

       "  'bio': 'Ladytron are an electronic band formed in 1999 in Liverpool, England. The band consists of Helen Marnie (also known as Marnie; lead vocals, synths), Mira Aroyo (vocals, synths), Daniel Hunt (synths, guitar) and Reuben Wu (synths). \\n\\nThey\\'ve released five studio albums so far: 604 (2001), Light & Magic (2002), Witching Hour (2005), Velocifero (2008) and Gravity the Seducer (2011).

Their sound is usually described as electropop mixed with new wave and shoegaze influences. \\n\\nLiverpool-based producers and DJs Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu met in the 1990s. Hunt was the founder of the indie record label Invicta Hi-Fi and of a nightclub. Wu trained in Industrial Design at Sheffield Hallam University and graduated in 1997. He became an industrial designer at Team Consulting Limited until 2002.\\n\\nUsing the moniker Ladytron, taken from the song \"Ladytron\" by Roxy Music, Hunt and Wu recorded the debut single \"He Took Her to a Movie\" with the guest vocalist Lisa Eriksson (who later formed the band Techno Squirrels). \"He Took Her to a Movie\" was released in July 1999 and gained positive reviews. \\n\\nIn the summer of 1999, Hunt and Wu met Helen Marnie (born in 1978 in Glasgow, Scotland) and Mira Aroyo (born in 1977 in Sofia, Bulgaria). Marnie and Aroyo joined Ladytron as vocalists and keyboard players. Marnie studied music at the University of Liverpool where she received a Bachelor of Arts in pop music in 1999. Aroyo was a postgraduate research geneticist in the Oxford University\\'s Biochemistry department.\\n\\nIn December 1999, Ladytron issued the EP Miss Black and Her Friends in Japan only. It was followed in June 2000 by the EP Commodore Rock and in October 2000 by Mu-Tron EP. All the songs from these EPs, except \"Miss Black\" and \"Olivetti Jerk\", were later included on their debut studio album. \"He Took Her to a Movie\", Mu-Tron EP, \"The Way That I Found You\", were all selected as NME \"Single of the Week\".\\n\\nIn 6 February 2001, Ladytron released their critically acclaimed debut album, 604 on Emperor Norton (US). The album was also released in 26 March 2001 on Labels (Germany) and in 2 April 2001 on Invicta Hi-Fi (UK).

Until 2004, the band wore uniforms on stage. Daniel Hunt stated in 2001 that their uniforms were inspired by the SF movie The Andromeda Strain. In an interview from 2002, Hunt also said that the meaning of 604 album title is the area code for British Columbia.\\n\\nIn 17 September 2002, Ladytron released their sophomore album Light & Magic at Emperor Norton (US) and Telstar (UK). The album was also released in 7 April 2003 at Warner Music (Germany) and in 21 June 2003 at Victor Entertainment (Japan).

They toured over a year to support this album.\\n\\nIn 7 October 2003, they issued the mix compilation Softcore Jukebox on Emperor Norton. The compilation includes songs of other artists selected by the band and also two of their own songs: the single remix of \"Blue Jeans\" renamed \"Blue Jeans 2.0\" and the cover \"Oops Oh My\" by Tweet.

The album featured live drums and guitars mixed with their trademark sound. This album was very well received by critics and fans. It was supported by the singles \"Sugar\" and \"Destroy Everything You Touch\". The single \"Destroy Everything You Touch\" became the band\\'s signature song.\\n\\nTheir third album was followed in 2006 by Extended Play, a two-disc EP CD/DVD compilation that features exclusive unreleased remixes and UK B-sides, as well as a 35-minute bonus DVD that included a 27 minutes documentary titled Once Upon a Time in the East: Ladytron in China based on their short 2004 tour in China. In the same year Ladytron recorded The Harmonium Sessions, which contained four reworked songs from Witching Hour.\\n\\nWithout any real label support, Ladytron toured exhaustively over the next two years, on the strength of their cult following. They played in North America, Europe, and South America. They also opened for Nine Inch Nails in early 2007 at the request of Trent Reznor.\\n\\nAlong their career, Ladytron have produced remixes for many artists, including Dave Gahan, Goldfrapp, Placebo, Blondie, Bloc Party, Kings of Convenience, Gang of Four, She Wants Revenge, Soulwax, Nine Inch Nails, Simian, Indochine and Apoptygma Berzerk.\\n\\nIn 2 June 2008, the group issued on Nettwerk their fourth album, Velocifero. The album was recorded in Paris, with the band handling production duties with Alessandro Cortini (Modwheelmood, Nine Inch Nails, SONOIO) and Vicarious Bliss (Justice, DJ Mehdi). Their sound evolved to an even more organic sound and harsher beats. The band states that \"velocifero\" literally means \"bringer of speed\" and is also the name of a classic retro styled scooter. The album spawned three singles, \"Ghosts\", \"Runaway\" and \"Tomorrow\".\\n\\nIn 6 April 2009, Nettwerk issued the remix compilation Velocifero (Remixed & Rare). In the same year, the band self-released their first live album entitled Live at London Astoria 16.07.08. They also co-wrote and produced the songs \"Birds of Prey\" and  \"Little Dreamer\" for Christina Aguilera. These songs featured on her 2010 album Bionic.\\n\\nIn 2009, Ladytron toured North America with The Faint (co-headline tour), and performed two special shows with Brian Eno at the Sydney Opera House in the summer. They also announced that they will be the opening act for Depeche Mode on few concerts in Eastern Europe, but these concerts were cancelled due to Dave Gahan\\'s illness.\\n\\nThe soundtrack of the video game FIFA 11 featured a new Ladytron song, \"Ace of Hz\", which was released as digital single on 30 November 2010. In 11 January 2011, the band issued the digital EP Ace of Hz, which includes the album mix plus 5 remixes. \\n\\nIn 28 March 2011, Ladytron released the compilation Best of 00-10 on Nettwerk.

They also issued the remix compilation Best of Remixes and the iTunes video compilation Best of 00-10 Videos.\\n\\nIn 12 September 2011, they released the fifth studio album, Gravity the Seducer, on Nettwerk. The album was recorded in Kent\\'s countryside and it was produced by the band and Barny Barnicott (Arctic Monkeys, Kasabian, Editors). Daniel Hunt said \"Gravity the Seducer is more of a jump than the last album was, more ethereal and melodic, a touch more abstract in places than we\\'ve gone before, baroque \\'n\\' roll\".\\n\\nGravity the Seducer has been preceded by the single \"White Elephant\", issued on 17 May 2011. The band premiered the song \"Ambulances\", in 16 June 2011. It was followed by the single \"Mirage\" in 8 August 2011.\\n\\nOn 20 December 2011, Nettwerk issued the remix compilations 604 (Remixed & Rare), Light & Magic (Remixed & Rare), Witching Hour (Remixed & Rare).\\n\\nUsing the stage name of Marnie, Helen Marnie started in 2012 a solo career. She self-released her debut solo album Crystal World on  11 June 2013. The album was produced in 2012 in Reykjavik, Iceland by her band mate Daniel Hunt in collaboration with the Icelandic musician Barði Jóhannsson.\\n\\nTouring:\\nThere have been six main Ladytron tours: 604 tour (2001), Light & Magic tour (2002–2004), Witching Hour tour (2005–2007), Velocifero tour (2008–2009), Best of 00-10 tour (2011), and Gravity the Seducer tour (2011).

Akie Bermiss (keyboards) joined the band on tour in 2017 and is on their 2018 album. Lake Street Dive started at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston. The band was named after a street with many dive bars in Olson\\'s hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota. \\n\\nAfter meeting as fellow students at the New England Conservatory in Boston, the band was hand picked by Minneapolis trumpet/guitar player Mike Olson and named after an actual neighborhood of seedy bars in his hometown. Vocalist Rachael Price came from outside Nashville, Tennessee, stand-up bassist Bridget Kearney was an Iowa native, while drummer Mike Calabrese called Philadelphia home. “I wasn’t only impressed with their musicianship,” says Olson, who acquired the nickname “McDuck” while at the conservatory for his reclusive ways. “They were also a lot of fun just to hang out with.

       " {'name': 'Lee Fields',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Lee Fields (b. Wilson, NC, USA - as one of four children), is currently leader of Lee Fields & The Expressions, which released My World (2009).\\n\\nLee spent his adolescence singing in church & listening to rnb, from the likes of: James Brown, The Temptations, Eddie Floyd, Otis Redding & the 60s Memphis sound. He joined a few of the South\\'s racial balance groups & began playing college circuits, inc\\' East Carolina University, Duke University & Georgia Tech. By the late-60s, he\\'d begun a singing career, working with bands which would lay the foundation for funk music, inc\\'s Kool & The Gang, Sammy Gordon & The Hip Huggers & Little Royal.\\n \\nRenowned throughout the global Funk community,  Lee Fields has poured his grunts and screams over a legacy of funk and soul hits from the early seventies, including such 45 rpm classics as She’s a Lovemaker, The Bullis Coming, and The Funky Screw, not to mention his well sought after Let’s Talk It Over LP. This LP draws four digit bids from collectors worldwide. His recordings with the hard funk purists at TRUTH & SOUL, Desco, and Daptone Records in recent years has solidified his place as the King of contemporary funk music as well.\\n \\nWhen Truth & Soul started as a record label in 2004, the first mission of label owners Jeff Silverman and Leon Michels, was to record a sweet soul record that would be modeled after the near perfect formula that bands like The Moments, The Delfonics, and The Stylistics had created.  Music that was both tough as nails and sweet as honey.  Music with laced with lush strings and smooth vocal harmonies layered over hard-hitting rhythms.  Michels and Silverman called in a few trusty associates, which included singer Lee Fields, and recorded the single “Do You Love Me” b/w “Honey Dove”.  What happened in the studio was pure magic and thus, The Expressions were born.\\n\\nFast forward almost two years and The Expressions featuring Lee Fields have successfully created a unique and personal sound that can hold court with the bands they set out to emulate.  However, what was created in the process goes beyond just a carbon copy of a sweet soul music.  The music has developed into a deeply soulful mix of old and new.  The formula stayed the same but the style has been adapted for the ears of people who didn’t grow up on Al Green or Sam Cooke.  Elements of modern music have crept their way into the mix to create something entirely fresh and unique.  The Expressions have surely lived up to the name, each song they make is choked full of raw emotion that permeates deep through your ear hole straight to the soul. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lee+Fields\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Little Steven',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Litte Steven is one of the stage names of Steve van Zandt (born November 22, 1950), an American musician, songwriter, arranger, record producer, actor, and radio disc jockey best known as a member of Bruce Springsteen & The E Street Band, in which he plays guitar and mandolin, and as an actor in the television drama The Sopranos, in which he played Silvio Dante.\\n\\nvan Zandt was born as Steven Lento in Winthrop, Massachusetts. His mother, Mary Lento, remarried when he was young and Steven took the last name of his stepfather, William Van Zandt. The family moved from Massachusetts to Middletown Township, New Jersey when he was seven.\\n\\nVan Zandt subsequently became a songwriter and producer for fellow Jersey shore act Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes in the mid- to late-1970s, penning their signature song \"I Don\\'t Wanna Go Home\", co-writing other songs for them with Springsteen, and producing their most-acclaimed record, Hearts of Stone. As such, Van Zandt became a key contributor to the Jersey Shore sound. Van Zandt then went on to share production credits on the classic Springsteen albums Darkness on the Edge of Town, The River, and Born in the U.S.A..\\n\\nVan Zandt has produced a number of other records, including an uncredited effort on the Iron City Houserockers\\' Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive). Less successful was his work on Lone Justice\\'s second album Shelter, which was a career-ending flop for the Los Angeles cowpunk band.\\n\\nIn 2004, he contributed the song \"Baby Please Don\\'t Go\" to Nancy Sinatra\\'s self-titled album\\n\\nVan Zandt officially left the E Street Band in 1984 (Springsteen\\'s song \"Bobby Jean\" is said to be inspired by the split) and has been involved in numerous solo musical projects and collaborations since then, ranging from soul music to hard rock to world music. In particular, he released four albums in the 1980s and one in 1999, sometimes fronting an on-and-off group known as Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul. Van Zandt has written that these albums are each elements in a five-part concept cycle. The first of them, 1982\\'s white soul Men Without Women, earned the most critical praise (Jay Cocks of TIME magazine dubbed it one of the ten best albums of the year), while its follow-up, 1984\\'s Voice of America, did the best on the U.S. albums chart, although none of them were much of a commercial success. With Voice of America, his music became explicitly political, with the central theme being opposition to Ronald Reagan-era American foreign policy.\\n\\nContinuing his involvement in issues of the day, in 1985 he created the music-industry activist group Artists United Against Apartheid as an action against the Sun City resort in South Africa. Forty-nine top recording artists, including Springsteen, U2, Bob Dylan and Run DMC, collaborated on a song called \"Sun City\" in which they pledged they would never perform at the resort. The effort was modestly successful. In 1987 he released the album Freedom - No Compromise, which continued the political messaging in an even more strident fashion. Some U.S. appearances in that year as opening act for U2\\'s arena-and-stadium Joshua Tree Tour continued in the same vein – Oliver North was labelled a \"criminal motherfucker\" – but were not well-received by audiences, who found the sound overbearing and the performances lacking musicality. Both the record and his concerts were more popular in Europe, however. Little Steven\\'s fourth album, 1989\\'s Revolution, attracted little attention.\\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Van_Zandt <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Little+Steven\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Lizzo',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Melissa Jefferson (born April 27, 1988 in Detroit, Michigan, U.S.), known professionally as Lizzo, is an American rapper and singer. She is a founding member of indie hip hop groups The Chalice, Grrrl Prty, The Clerb, Ellypseas, and Absynthe. Her debut album, Lizzobangers, was released in 2013. In 2015, she released her sophomore album, Big Grrrl Small World.\\n\\nBorn in Detroit in the late 80’s, Lizzo spent much of her formative years in the church, where she was raised on the gospel sounds of The Winans, The Clark Sisters, and Fred Hammond, along with mainstay secular artists such as Stevie Wonder and Elton John. At the age of 10 her family moved to Houston, TX, and Lizzo was exposed to a wide array of emerging Southern musical styles, from the trademark chopped and screwed rap tracks of the underground, to the progressive and polished R&B sounds of groups like Destiny’s Child that were raising the city’s national profile to new heights. In fact, it was after she stumbled across a Destiny’s Child performance at Wal-Mart that Lizzo—then a 5th grader-- was inspired to start writing music on her own. Over the next decade that decision would take her through the trenches of some of the most varied musical genres: R&B girl groups (I.N.I.T.I.A.L.S., Cornrow Clique), progressive rock bands (Elypseas), solo rap ventures, and electro-pop duos (Lizzo & The Larva Ink).\\n\\nIn 2011 she made the move to Minneapolis with Larva Ink in order to be a part of that city’s blossoming and collaborative musical community. Lizzo & The Larva Ink was well received there, and the group earned a few encouraging nods from the press. Lizzo was soon introduced to Sophia Eris and Claire de Lune, with whom she would form The Chalice, the three-piece all-female rap/R&B group that would elevate Lizzo’s profile and reputation. In 2012 The Chalice released We Are The Chalice, an album that would gain them instant local success amongst fans and critics alike, garnering City Pages’ prestigious Best New Band and Picked To Click accolades in the same year. \\n\\nThe success brought setbacks, though, and a falling out soon led to the demise of Lizzo & The Larva Ink. Feeling discontent with the loss of one group and the hurried blur of success of another, Lizzo was creatively drained from writing We Are The Chalice in two short months. She found herself in the throes of her first full-blown case of writer’s block. Unable to create music for herself, she began listening to several different local albums in hopes of finding inspiration. It was LAVA BANGERS, a 20-track instrumental mixtape from Doomtree producer and Minneapolis music vet Lazerbeak, that ultimately caught her ear. Beaks’ beats proved the fix for Lizzo’s problem. “I sat at home and listened to LAVA BANGERS, and when “Lift Every Voice” came on, my writer’s block was cured,” says Lizzo. “I think it revived my gospel roots. I wrote pages and pages of songs, and finally reached out to Lazerbeak, not thinking anything would come of it.” \\n\\nHer timing could not have been better. Beak, impressed with Lizzo’s output with The Chalice, as well as her guest appearances on several other local releases, was looking for a change of pace from his daily Doomtree production and business responsibilities. He immediately signed on to work on some demos. Beat tapes were exchanged, songs were written, and mutual friend and musical collaborator Ryan Olson (Totally Gross National Product founder, Gayngs/Marijuana Deathsquads mastermind) was brought on board to creatively oversee the project. Olson recorded and edited all 15 tracks in his bedroom studio, bringing in laid back hype-man Cliff Rhymes along the way to add even more layers to Lizzo’s dynamic vocals.\\n\\nLIZZOBANGERS is the culmination of that four-way collaboration, an album that manages to capture all of the varied musical influences of Lizzo’s upbringing and combine them with the forward-thinking experimental production style of Beak and Olson. The end result is a brave new project that encapsulates the best parts of both the familiar and the future.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lizzo\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Local Natives (formerly cavil at rest) is an indie rock band based in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, CA, United States.\\nAfter the three founding members originally met in high school, a bassist and a drummer were found, and they all moved to a house in Silver Lake in 2008 to record their album. Their debut album as Local Natives, \"Gorilla Manor\", was released in the UK on November 2nd, 2009, and saw a US release date of February 16th, 2010. The band\\'s sound has been described as \"afropop-influenced guitars with hyperactive drumming and hooky three-part harmonies\". They started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 SXSW festival in Austin, Texas. Initial reviews of Local Natives have drawn favourable comparisons to Arcade Fire, Fleet Foxes and Vampire Weekend.\\n\\nUtilizing lots of vocal harmonies and drifting, dreamlike melodies, Local Natives have an intricate sound based around the delicate interconnectedness of all of their parts. This gives the band a sound that is able to be orchestral while still feeling understated, evoking the carefully assembled pop of Grizzly Bear. Their debut, Gorilla Manor, arrived in 2009 through U.K. label Infectious Records (with a domestic release coming by way of Frenchkiss in 2010).

       "  'bio': 'The Lowest of the Low were a Canadian alternative rock group in the early 1990s. Although they never broke through to the mainstream, they were one of the most influential bands on the Canadian alternative music scene.\\n\\nFormed by Ron Hawkins, Stephen Stanley and David Alexander, the band was originally known as Popular Front. The band\\'s punk-inspired jangle pop quickly became a popular draw on the Queen Street West club circuit in Toronto.\\n\\nIn 1991 they released their debut album, Shakespeare My Butt, featuring songs they had already performed and toured for several years as Popular Front. Hawkins\\'s songs were filled with lyrics about Marxism and the Spanish Civil War, but also contained many references to Toronto landmarks like the Don River, Bathurst Street, and his local pub, \"The Only\" on Danforth Avenue. The album was actively supported by Toronto radio station CFNY, and quickly made the band a popular name across southern Ontario and western New York. The album became one of the best-selling independent releases in Canadian history (although it was eclipsed in the same year by Barenaked Ladies\\' Yellow Tape), and was later named one of the ten greatest albums in Canadian music history by the music magazine Chart.[1]\\n\\nIn 1993, the band signed a distribution deal with A&M Records, and released Hallucigenia in 1994. Unfortunately, the band was riven with tensions, and broke up later the same year.\\n\\nHawkins released a solo album, The Secret of My Excess, in 1996, and then formed Ron Hawkins and the Rusty Nails.\\n\\nn 2000, The Lowest of the Low set aside their differences for a five-show reunion tour, which saw the band playing to sold-out venues in Toronto and Buffalo, New York. In 2001, the live album Nothing Short of a Bullet was released. The album also featured a second disc with three new studio songs, including a cover of a Bad Religion song.\\n\\nSordid Fiction, the band\\'s first new studio album since 1994, was released in 2004. Following the tour for that record, the band went on extended hiatus again.\\n\\nIn November 2007 the band announced that they were breaking up for good. They played two final shows, one on December 4, 2007 at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto and another on December 8, 2007 at Club Infinity in Williamsville, New York. This concert was released by fans of the band as a DVD, incorporating several camcorder recordings of the show and a soundboard audio patch. The fan released DVD was entitled Into the Black, and can be downloaded on Ron Hawkins\\' web site.\\n\\n\"Rosy and Grey\", from Shakespeare My Butt, has been covered by Weddings Parties Anything.

Affected by the minimalist movement in the early 1970s, he has developed his own unique language for the piano, named after the principle of maintaining a continuous, unbroken stream of sound.\\n \\nMelnyk has shown a remarkable devotion to the instrument, always striving to discover new ways of composing music in the continuous mode. His focus is on the actual sound of the piano as much as the harmonies and melodies of the music.\\n \\nUsing rapid and complex note patterns, Lubomyr\\'s virtuoso piano technique forms overtones that blend, collide or even create new melodies in rare moments, and thereby shape the composition beyond its original form. Accomplishing this requires a special technique, one that has taken him many years to master.\\n\\nMelnyk lived in Winnipeg, Manitoba from 1950 to 1969. He earned a degree in Latin and Philosophy from St. Paul\\'s College in Winnipeg, and did postgraduate work in Philosophy at Queen\\'s University in Kingston, Ontario, from 1969 to 1970. Melnyk lived in Paris from 1973 to 1975, supporting himself by playing for modern dance classes. Many of the works of his Paris years were presented in conjunction with modern dance. It was there that he began to create \\'continuous music\\' for piano. On his return to Canada, Melnyk performed and presented his new \\'language\\' for the piano in lecture-recitals throughout Canada and Europe.\\n\\nSince the early 1970s, Melnyk has composed over 90 works, mostly for piano solo or ensemble. In order to explain the mechanism of reading the score and performing it with the proper hand motions, Melnyk wrote the treatise OPEN TIME: The Art of Continuous Music (1981) and 22 Etudes, to teach the fundamental levels of the continuous technique\\n\\nhttp://www.lubomyr.com\\nhttp://www.erasedtapes.com  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lubomyr+Melnyk\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Luna, a dream pop/indie rock band formed in 1991 by Dean Wareham after the breakup of Galaxie 500, with Stanley Demeski formerly of The Feelies and Justin Harwood formerly of the New Zealand band The Chills. Described by Rolling Stone magazine as “the best band you’ve never heard of,” Luna blended nuanced guitar work, shading dynamics, and Wareham\\'s wry wit. The original line-up was expanded with the addition of guitarist Sean Eden for their second album, 1994\\'s Bewitched. Lee Wall replaced Demeski on drums in time for 1997\\'s Pup Tent, and Britta Phillips of The Belltower (also known as the singing voice of animated character Jem) joined when bassist Justin Harwood departed in 2000.

       " {'name': 'Lust for Youth',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Lust for Youth is the solo vehicle of Swedish electronic musician Hannes Norrvide. The project began in 2009 in  Gothenburg , Sweden at a collective venue/practice space when Norrvide\\'s friends were starting up a punk band. He was inspired to join in, but he only had access to a somewhat useless toy keyboard, so due to the limitations of his instrument, he opted instead to make music alone. The early experiments of Lust for Youth were raw, primitive, and drony. Norrvide worked on the project tirelessly, releasing several cassette albums and miscellaneous 7\" singles before the release of 2011\\'s proper full-length, Solar Flare, on the Italian label Avant! Records. At this point Lust for Youth had grown from its hazy beginnings into a tormented darkwave sound, minimal electronics, and gothic beats that bordered on harsh noise. Loke Rahbek of Sexdrome joined Hannes in collaboration following the release of the record, and the duo played shows throughout Europe. In 2012 the harsh and dissonant Growing Seeds album materialized, released again on Avant! in Europe and on Sacred Bones in the United States. Around that time the band relocated from Sweden to Copenhagen, Denmark. They followed in 2013 with third album Perfect View, again released on Sacred Bones. For the following year\\'s International, Norrvide continued the dark synth pop direction of Perfect View, polishing and streamlining it with the help of producer Malthe Fisher and collaborator Rahbek. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Lust+for+Youth\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The bgroupwas formed in California, United States in 1989 shortly after Lynch quit Dokken. The band\\'s line-up has been a revolving door of members who have come and gone, and in some cases returned. The band\\'s debut album, featuring vocalist Oni Logan (ex-Cold Sweat), was 1990\\'s \\'Wicked Sensation\\'.\\n\\nThat release received praise as great hard rock/heavy metal album from many fans as well as from music critics, with the All Music Guide\\'s Eduardo Rivadavia stating that many songs \"find the band locking on to a powerful groove\". Despite poor sales, many felt that if it had been recorded a few years earlier it would have sold very well and maybe even hit number one.\\n\\nStill, the group solidered on, and 1992\\'s self-titled follow up Lynch Mob featured new vocalist Robert Mason in Logan\\'s place. Yet, in the wake of even poorer sales figures and some critical reviews, the group disbanded in 1993.\\n\\nLynch spent the mid-90s in a reunited Dokken line-up, but by 1998  he had once again quit Dokken and was working on a new rap-metal version of Lynch Mob. 1999\\'s Smoke This was poorly received, prompting another split.\\n\\nIn 2003, Lynch, Mason and original bassist Anthony Esposito reformed yet another incarnation of Lynch Mob, this time updating their original sound rather than follow the rap-metal direction of the late 90s iteration of the band.\\n\\nThis line-up didn\\'t last long, and Lynch soon turned his attention to solo albums and his band with former Brides of Destruction singer London LeGrand, Souls of We. \\n\\nIn 2008, the original line-up of Dokken was slated to play Rocklahoma, but when the reunion fell through Lynch used the opportunity to reunite Lynch Mob with original vocalist Oni Logan.\\n\\nThe album Smoke and Mirrors was released in 2009, with Lynch and Logan describing it as the proper follow-up to Wicked Sensation. \\n\\nUnfortunately, despite the album receiving a relatively positive reception from fans, Lynch Mob\\'s line-up has been especially volatile in recent years. Numerous members have come and gone, including bassists Marco Mendoza and James Lomenzo and drummer Brian Tichy. Mick Brown also rejoined the band briefly. A few shows in 2010 even saw vocalists Marq Torien (Bulletboys) and Keith St. John (Montrose) fill in for Logan. \\n\\nIn July 2011, when Lynch Mob was set to embark on a US tour, Logan suddenly quit the band. Chas West (ex-Bonham) was quickly brought in to finish the tour. \\n\\nIn January 2012, Lynch announced that Jesse Forte (ex-Vains of Jenna) would be the new singer of Lynch Mob. However, soon after, Forte explained that Lynch informed him by phone that he and Logan had reconciled.

It was an excellent way to round off 2012, a year made all the nicer when Maribou State\\'s remix of Ultraista\\'s \\'Gold Dayzz\\' went viral, plonking the pair at the top of the Hype Machine chart once again and hitting over 200,000 plays on SoundCloud.\\n\\nTheir first major release of this year was another collaboration with Pedestrian. Signed by Polish house duo Catz \\'N Dogz and put out via their Pets imprint, \\'Mask\\' pushed Maribou State firmly to the fore of the British scene, running alongside Disclosure, Bondax and AlunaGeorge as artists dedicated to making accessible yet highly inventive dance music. The record also gained further radio play from Zane Lowe, Hugh Stephens and Rob Da Bank, as well as long-time supporters Annie Mac, B. Traits and Pete Tong.\\n\\nAs 2013 began to unfurl, Chris and Liam will release their latest single for Southern Fried, a record that marks the next stage of their career. A double-A side including \\'Tongue\\' and \\'Larks Rise\\', it sees them realise their vision of creating organic dance music in the same kind of way as Bonobo and Four Tet, forging field recordings and live instrumentation with broken house rhythms and waves of sub-bass.\\n\\nhttp://mariboustate.tumblr.com <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Maribou+State\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Their eponymous first album was released in 1984, and their latest, XI, in 2016.[1]\\nThe band is credited as a formative influence on the thrash metal subgenre,[1] melding the aesthetics of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal and American hard rock with \"incredibly tight musicianship\" and \"piercingly screeched\" vocals.[2][3] Early lyrical topics such as conflict and paranoia later expanded into philosophical and social commentary.\\nFounding guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof remained the group\\'s sole consistent creative force throughout its career, despite reducing his role strictly to composition in 1986 after tiring of performing. Vanderhoof, vocalist David Wayne, guitarist Craig Wells, bassist Duke Erickson, and drummer Kirk Arrington composed the group\\'s classic lineup featured on its first two records, while vocalist Mike Howe and guitarist John Marshall later contributed to the group\\'s sound. After releasing five full-length albums and touring extensively throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Metal Church disbanded in 1994. They reformed four years later with their classic lineup, including Vanderhoof\\'s return to performance, yielding the Masterpeace album. They endured numerous lineup changes thereafter, releasing three further studio albums while fronted by Ronny Munroe before again disbanding in July 2009.

What began as an innocent night of snorting horse tranquilzers in a hotel room with seven members of the village jai alai team went on to produce the greatest metal band to ever live. Unhampered by a steady regime of tequila and ill advised sumo lessons, nine months later five bastard children where born. Unable to care for her hungry offspring and concerned that motherhood would seriously interfere with her Tuesday night Karaoke league, Consuela hastily packed the babies into the saddlebags of a burro and sent her children off to America in search of a better life. Against all odds, 14 years later, and nearly dead from dehydration, the burro knelt down to drink from the stagnant waters of the Rio Grande just ouside of Juarez Mexico –mere yards from the U.S. border. With one fleeting burst of energy the brothers Espinoza cinco climbed from their leather restraints and scampered the vast reach of the river, collapsing onto the sweet amber hue of American soil. As if by destiny, lodged in the sand beneath their tanned faces was a record sleeve upon which were the words “PARANOID” and “BLACK SABBATH”. For many years to follow, this definitive black metal album served not only as a teacher and a mentor..but also as a friend. From these bleak and humble begins grew the seed that would eventually be the band we know today.

       " {'name': 'Mulatu Astatke',\n",
       "  'bio': '\\nMulatu Astatke [ሙላቱ አስታጥቄ] (born on December 19, 1943; surname sometimes spelled Astatqé on French-language releases: Mulatu Astatqé) is an Ethiopian musician and arranger best known as the father of Ethio-jazz.\\n\\nBorn in the western Ethiopian city of Jimma, Mulatu was musically trained in London, New York City, and Boston where he combined his jazz and Latin music interests with traditional Ethiopian music. Astatke led his band while playing vibraphone and conga drums—instruments that he introduced into Ethiopian popular music—as well as other percussion instruments, keyboards and organ. His albums focus primarily on instrumental music, and Astatke appears on all three known albums of instrumentals that were released during Ethiopia\\'s Golden ’70s.\\n\\nAstatke\\'s family sent the young Mulatu to study engineering in Wales during the late 1950s. Instead, he earned a degree in music through studies at the Welsh Lindisfarne College and then Trinity College of Music in London. In the 1960s, Astatke moved to the United States, where he became the first African student to enroll at Boston\\'s prestigious Berklee College of Music, where he studied vibraphone and percussion.\\n\\nWhile living in the US, Astatke became interested in Latin jazz and recorded his first two albums, Afro-Latin Soul, Volumes 1 & 2, in New York City in 1966. The records prominently feature Astatke\\'s vibraphone, backed up by piano and conga drums playing Latin rhythms, and were entirely instrumental, with the exception of the song \"I Faram Gami I Faram,\" which was sung in Spanish. Though these records are almost indistinguishable from other Latin-jazz records of the period, some tracks foreshadow elements of Astatke\\'s later work, and he is credited as having established conga and bongo drums as common elements in Ethiopian popular music.\\n\\nIn the early 1970s, Astatke brought his new sound, which he called Ethio-jazz, back to his homeland while continuing to work in the US. He collaborated with many notable artists in both countries, arranging and playing on recordings by Mahmoud Ahmed, and appearing as a special guest with Duke Ellington and his band during a tour of Ethiopia in 1973.\\n\\nDuring this time, Astatke recorded another album in New York, Mulatu of Ethiopia (1972). Meanwhile, the bulk of his recorded material was being released on Amha Eshèté\\'s eponymous Ethiopian label Amha Records in Addis Ababa, which released several Mulatu Astatke singles along with the 1974 album Yekatit Ethio-Jazz and six out of the 10 tracks on that year\\'s Ethiopian Modern Instrumentals Hits compilation. Astatke\\'s records appeared alongside releases by notable Ethiopian vocalists Mahmoud Ahmed, Tlahoun Gèssèssè, Alèmayèhu Eshèté, and others, all of whose music was influenced by the infusion of American jazz and Latin instrumentation that Astatke brought to Ethiopia.\\n\\nBy 1975, Amha Records had ceased production after the Derg military junta forced the label\\'s owner and many other Ethio-jazz luminaries to flee the country. Astatke stuck around long enough to play vibes for Hailu Mergia and the Wallias Band\\'s 1977 album Tche Belew (which featured the original classic \"Musicawi Silt\") before the Wallas also left Ethiopia to tour internationally. But by the 1980s, Astatke\\'s music was largely forgotten outside of his homeland.\\n\\nBy the early 1990s, many record collectors had rediscovered the music of Mulatu Astatke and were combing stashes of vinyl for copies of his 1970s releases. In 1998, the Parisian record label Buda Musique began to reissue many of the Amha-era Ethio-jazz recordings on compact disc as part of the series ethiopiques, and the first of these reissues to be dedicated to a single artist was Éthiopiques Volume 4: Ethio Jazz & Musique Instrumentale, 1969–1974, Mulatu Astatke. The album brought Astatke\\'s music to a new international audience, perhaps the largest in his career.\\n\\nHis Western audience expanded even further when the 2005 Jim Jarmusch film Broken Flowers featured seven of Astatke\\'s songs, including one performed by Cambodian-American rock band Dengue Fever. National Public Radio used Astatke\\'s instrumentals as beds under or between pieces, notably on the program This American Life. Hip hop artists have also sampled Astatke\\'s songs extensively, samples can be heard in the works of for example Nas, Damian Marley, Kanye West, Cut Chemist, Quantic, Madlib, Oddisee, and Knaan.\\nAfter meeting the Massachusetts-based Either/Orchestra in Addis Ababa in 2004, Mulatu began a collaboration with the band with performances in Scandinavia in summer 2006 and London, New York, Germany, Holland, Glastonbury (UK), Dublin, and Toronto in 2008. In the fall of 2008, he collaborated with the London-based psyche-jazz collective The Heliocentrics on the album Inspiration Information Vol. 3, which included re-workings of his earlier Ethio-jazz classics with new material by the Heliocentrics and himself; Mulatu Astatke & The Heliocentrics. \\n\\nIn 2008, Mulatu completed a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship at Harvard University, where he worked on modernizations of traditional Ethiopian instruments and premiered a portion of a new opera, The Yared Opera. Mulatu also served as an Abramowitz Artist-in-Residence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, delivering lectures and workshops, as well as advising MIT\\'s Media Lab on creating a modern version of the krar, a traditional Ethiopian instrument.\\nOn February 1, 2009, Mulatu Astatke performed at the Luckman Auditorium in Los Angeles with a band that included such notable jazz musicians as Bennie Maupin, Azar Lawrence, and Phil Ranelin. Mulatu also released a two-disc set to be sold exclusively to passengers of Ethiopian Airlines, with the first disc being a compilation of the different styles from different regions of Ethiopia and the second being studio originals. On May 12, 2012, Mulatu received an honorary doctor of music degree from the Berklee College of Music.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Mulatu+Astatke\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Having a family of wanderers who migrated across the U.S. every few years, the landscape and the musical influences were constantly changing: Spanish tangos, Sunday morning gospel, classical and jazz were the accompaniment to her home life. Her first song was recorded when she was three years old, and by the age of eight she was studying piano and performing in community musical productions.\\n\\nAs a teenager in Michigan, Shara honed her musical prowess singing along to Whitney Houston music videos and Mariah Carey albums. When pop music wasn\\'t enough, she enrolled in the music program at the University of North Texas, immersing herself in the songs of Henry Purcell and Claude Debussy. After college, she moved to New York City and fell in love with its cold winters and busy streets. She continued to study opera on the Upper West Side during the day, but at night she frequented downtown clubs such as Tonic, Knitting Factory, and The Living Room, catching performances by Antony and the Johnsons, Nina Nastasia, and Rebecca Moore. She began to spend less time sight-reading Mozart and more time de-tuning her Gibson electric guitar to play her own newly-written songs. Coaxed out of recital halls and onto the small stages of bars and clubs, Shara assembled a coterie of musicians to accompany her with bass and drums, music boxes, wine glasses, and wind chimes. She released two full albums in 2001 (AwRY and Quiet B Sides) as well as a remix album with her band entitled AwRY.\\n\\nIn performance she showed unusual versatility, channeling the vocal theatrics of Kate Bush, the soulful seductiveness of Nina Simone and the gothic pop of Portishead. Her infatuation with theater and costumes inspired her to wear superhero capes, ball gowns, or Tudor corsets on stage, depending on her mood. Her deeply personal songs transcended the histrionics of opera; Shara was at last singing about what was closest to her heart. She began to see her own music as the most precious gift she could give to the world - as reflected in her namesake, \"My Brightest Diamond\".\\n\\nOf course, opera never really left her, and Shara\\'s performance blurred the lines between rock show and recital, setting baroque love songs alongside French carols and Prince covers. Her vocal lines reached for Puccini, but her guitar was pure PJ Harvey. The center of gravity here was the workmanship of a woman whose imagination had no limits. To sharpen her skills, Shara studied composition with Australian composer Padma Newsome (of Clogs) and began to incorporate a string quartet in her live show. The influences of Nat King Cole and Henry Mancini rounded out the edges. A few years later, she met Sufjan Stevens at The Medicine Show, a variety show hosted by New York City\\'s incendiary poet, Sage, at Arlene\\'s Grocery. This, in turn, led to a yearlong sabbatical from her work, doing splits and round-offs (not to mention the human pyramid) as one of the notorious Illinoisemakers. Shara was quickly promoted as cheerleading captain.\\n\\nAll of this led to an impressive resume, but My Brightest Diamond still had no album to show for it. So in 2004, she began work on two records: one featuring songs accompanied by a string quartet titled \"A Thousand Shark\\'s Teeth\", and a more standard rock album featuring a full band (featuring Earl Harvin on drums, Chris Bruce on bass, and, on one song, her father Keith on accordion) titled \"Bring Me The Workhorse\", released to critical acclaim in August 2006 on Asthmatic Kitty Records.\\n\\nHer songs distil stories to their most distressing points of contact: a phone call, an injured horse, a dragonfly caught in a spider\\'s web. She doesn\\'t share all the information - just the stuff that matters. The effect is a sensational compression of time, in which an entire event is summarized in a single note. This, of course, is the essence of opera. But My Brightest Diamond is much more than that. There is also the humor one might find in an old TV episode of Wonder Woman or Lewis Carroll\\'s Alice in Wonderland. Shara\\'s songs reconcile all the complex emotions found in each of us: she can grieve as comfortably as she can laugh, sometimes in the same breath.\\n\\nSites: BandCamp <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/My+Brightest+Diamond\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'http://www.myspace.com/nationalbr\\nNational is an experimental electronic duo Agnaldo Mori (teclados e efeitos) and Glauco Félix (teclados, guitarra, DJ efeitos) from Sao Paulo, Brazil. They work with all kinds of homemade experimentations with music. With many different instruments, lots of keyboards and synthesizers, guitars, pianos, computers, sequencers, samplers and voice effects, they produce an unclassifiable and eclectic electronic sound. They are extremely eccentric and they do everything themselves, on their own homes and on their own equipment, from the compositions and recordings to the production of the CDs and the jewel boxes and the sleeves. The duo has been together for some years and they\\'ve done pretty much everything: porn soundtracks, novelty songs and parodies, more \\'traditional\\' electronic dance music, idm, downtempo, breakbeat, braindance, all things always with a concept behind it. In 2001 they released their first piece of work, a disket-single, followed by two records, Disket-Delay and Insonia, the former all with ambient sounds and the latter built upon the concept of sleep. In the beginning of 2002, National came back with a revolutionary project: nine CDs at once, each one with a very complex concept behind it. Then and there were born records like the genius conceptual tribute to John Cage\\'s 4\"33\\', the bizarre compilations Sampler Vírus 1 and 2, the compilation of \\'forbidden songs\\' Plunderphonics All-stars, one record totally devoted to the ideas of the philosopher Pierre Lévy and more \\'serious\\' works, like Música para Mulheres Mutantes, C+A, Cinco e CD.\\n\\nIf you\\'re looking for The National, just follow the link. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/National\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Anaheim, California (2005 - Present) \\n\\nAfter building a reputation through D.I.Y. promotion on MySpace (along with some help from Tom, a fan of the band), the band released their debut E.P. in 2006. Their debut album \"My Dear\" followed in 2007. The band\\'s music is categorized as pop punk and alternative rock. \\n\\nBand History:\\nNew Years Day formed in 2005 after bassist Adam Lohrbach left the band Home Grown. Home Grown\\'s final E.P., 2004\\'s \"When it All Comes Down,\" had diverged from the band\\'s previous style of humorous pop punk and incorporated many emotional elements that Lohrbach carried over into New Years Day. Meeting with vocalist Ashley Costello (formerly of Face the Fact) and guitarist Keith Drover (formerly of Ugly), the three began rehearsing songs that Costello and Lorhbach had written. These songs were heavily influenced by the members\\' shared emotional experiences, as Lohrbach, Drover, and Costello had all recently been through difficult relationship break-ups NYD\\'s first bass player was Eric Seilo, a mutual friend of the three, although he had to leave soon after the band formed due to school issues. The group soon added guitarist/bassist Mike Schoolden (formerly of Wakefield) and drummer Russell Dixon (formerly of Glennhaven) and took the name New Years Day, after deciding that the name symbolized the fresh emotional start of the members, and the band name was also chosen on the holiday itself.\\n\\nThe band began building a reputation through D.I.Y.-produced promotions and posting songs on MySpace, and were featured on the MySpace Records Volume 1 compilation CD, and in the soundtrack of the video game Saint\\'s Row. After considering an offer from the Pete Wentz-run Decaydance Records label, the band signed to TVT Records and released a debut self-titled EP in 2006. Originally referred to as the Razor EP, it was primarily a digital release made available through download services such as iTunes, though CD copies were also available at the band\\'s peformances. They also performed at the South by Southwest music festival that same year.\\n\\nFrom 2006-2007 New Years Day self-financed and self-produced their debut album My Dear, recorded over an eight-month period at the home of producer Eugene Perreras. The album was released on May 8, 2007 and includes collaborations with members of Reel Big Fish and Motion City Soundtrack. The band\\'s debut music video for the lead single \"I Was Right\" won an MTVU \"Freshman Face\" poll and was added to the channel\\'s playlist.\\n\\nThe band suffered lack of promotion and tour support from their label T.V.T., who is now out of business.  Band members were lost. Drover left the band after the Warped Tour. Schoolden and Lohrbach followed.\\n\\nThe remaining members decided to continue making music. The band started writing new material in early 2009. Around September 2009, NYD posted two new songs on their MySpace page. Was to play Warped Tour 2010, releasing a debut album in Japan July 2010 with music from My dear, a lady gaga cover and material from their upcoming second album.\\n\\nAshley Costello\\nRussell Dixon\\nAnthony Barro\\nDan Arnold\\n\\nFormer Members:\\nKeith Drover - Guitar, backing vocals\\nMike Schoolden - Guitar/Bass, backing vocals\\nAdam Lohrbach - Bass/Guitar, backing vocals\\nEric Seilo - Bass <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/New+Years+Day\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Nitzer Ebb',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Formed in Chelmsford, UK when main protagonists Douglas McCarthy (vocals) and Bon Harris (drums, programming) were just 15, Nitzer Ebb cut a dynamic swathe through the electronic music and Balaeric beat scenes of the 1980s and 90s. They were electro-punks before the genre even existed, at a time when The Prodigy were not even a gleam in fellow Essex boy Liam Howlett\\'s eye. Militaristic, intimidating yet always accessible, Nitzer Ebb enjoyed a string of ferocious club hits and released five critically acclaimed albums on Mute. From their first-ever single, 1984\\'s \\'Isn\\'t It Funny How Your Body Works\\' through to their final 1995 single \\'I Thought\\', they were a band whose honed aggression, originality and precision were impeccable.\\n\\nThe band\\'s musical adventures first began in 1982 when McCarthy and Harris, along with drummer David Gooday, formed the group whilst still at school in Chelmsford. Listening to the likes of Abwärts, Neubauten, Malaria, DAF, Cabaret Voltaire, Killing Joke and Bauhaus among many others the boys began experimenting with synthesizers and samples culminating in the release of four singles on their own Power Of Voice Communications label (a joint venture with Pet Shop Boys producer Phil Harding) before Daniel Miller was impressed enough to sign them to his own label Mute.\\n\\nNitzer Ebb\\'s debut album, 1987\\'s brooding \\'That Total Age\\', displayed a brutalist yet polished élan. Following the powerful opening singles \\'Murderous\\' and \\'Let Your Body Learn\\', the band\\'s club reputation was truly secured with the release of \\'Join In The Chant\\', which in a version remixed by Phil Harding, became a staple in Britain\\'s acid house and techno clubs.\\n\\nHaving won over club-land the band turned their attentions to the live arena and at the invitation of label mates Depeche Mode, supported them on their huge Music for the Masses tour. Meanwhile original drummer Gooday departed to be replaced for live performances by Julian Beeston, whilst McCarthy and Harris returned to the studio with producer, Flood, to record the follow up to \\'That Total Age\\' for the album that would eventually become \\'Belief\\' and set in progress a highly creative partnership that would extend over four albums.\\n\\nThe new album once again retained the musical and visual aggression of their previous work. Yet \\'Belief\\' also hinted at the band\\'s growing ability to display a sense of wit, imagination and sheer caustic comment within their music. There were no sacred cows in terms of subject matter or indeed the band\\'s merciless capacity for piss taking.\\n\\nUpon its release \\'Belief\\' not only attracted much domestic critical praise but also saw their stock rise in Europe. In part this was aided by the series of remixes provided by the band for the singles \\'Control I\\'m Here\\', \\'Hearts & Minds\\' and \\'Shame\\'. Along with additional mixes by William Orbit they helped maintain the band\\'s popularity in the clubs and encourage the burgeoning fascination in Europe with what was then known as EBM (Electronic Body Music).\\n\\nIn 1990 the band and Flood once again returned to the studio with every intention of upping the ante even further. The resulting album \\'Showtime\\' showed further evidence of the band\\'s progression, combining their trademark energy with a growing musicality that added menacing depths to tracks such as \\'Getting Closer\\' and \\'Lightning Man\\'. The album also spawned a most improbable, though brilliantly effective remix of \\'Fun To Be Had\\' by George Clinton, the visionary behind two of the greatest freak-funk bands ever - Parliament and Funkadelic.\\n\\nArguably the success of this collaboration acted as a spur for the band\\'s next release, the EP \\'As Is\\'. This saw McCarthy and Harris working with four different mixers to reveal the different musical aspects at work within band. Their collaborators included Jaz Coleman of Killing Joke, a recording artist whose musical aggression was even more noted than their own, and Alan Wilder, then of Depeche Mode, who applied his noted production skills to enhance the melodic potential within the band.\\n\\nIt was this potential that the band sought to develop on their 4th album, \\'Ebbhead\\'. Released in 1991 the album was a full-blooded affair and with Alan Wilder joining Flood in the production hot seat it was perhaps no surprise to hear the rich musical instrumentation now firmly part of the band\\'s armoury. Any suggestion though that the Ebb were somehow softening up were blown away by the full on pulverising assault of \\'Godhead\\', an assault that had by now successfully overcome audiences in the US.\\n\\nThough it appeared that the main external battles had been won, the band were arguably now having to battle with the internal tensions that naturally had arisen following a decade sustaining an intense level of shared creativity. Four years in the making \\'Big Hit\\' finally made the light of day in 1995. The diverse and experimental nature of the band was still there, and in the lead-off single \\'Kick It\\', the Ebb showed that they could still easily conjure up those moments that would batter the listener into submission yet make it a strangely rewarding process at the same time.  Unfortunately, the band\\'s decicion to update their sound with grunge-inspired guitars fails throughout most of the album, as the big rock-styled choruses proved incompatible with the band\\'s signature electronics.  Once ahead of their time, but now left behind, Nitzer Ebb found their last release headed straight to the cutout bins.\\n\\nThe cracks that appeared between McCarthy and Harris during the making \\'Big Hit\\'--as well as longtime producer Flood\\'s inattentiveness to the group\\'s material--proved to be decisive and shortly after its release it became clear that another album would not be forthcoming. In fact it would take seven years before the band could bring themselves to talk to each other. Perhaps it was this enforced silence that encouraged critics to reassess the precocious impact and originality of the band, as a number of subsequent artists lined up to cite them as a major influence, or less honourably, simply exploiting the Ebb\\'s musical template for their own individual gain. Whilst such a situation may be a cause of great annoyance to most bands, the Ebb maintain a healthy level of stoicism. As they say, “That\\'s the problem with being ahead of the game - the pioneers get the arrows and the settlers get the land.”\\n\\nIn the end of 2005 when the quantity of requests for new Nitzer Ebb live acts went beyond the limits McCarthy and Harris met to discuss the possibility of reunion. Since the beginning of 2006 they started to give concerts and since summer Nitzer Ebb are on reunion tour. A 2CD compilation of best tracks and a bunch of remixes \"Body Of Work\" was released in may and later, in july, a remixes album \"Body Reworked\" followed. For the tour Nitzer Ebb hired a new drummer - Kourtney Klein, mostly known for her work in CombiChrist. In august of 2006 it was officially confirmed that Nitzer Ebb are working on the new material. The recording actually started in March 2007. New record is going to be produced by british producer Jagz Kooner and should be issued, according to Douglas McCarthy, at spring 2008.  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Nitzer+Ebb\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Northlane is a progressive metalcore band from Sydney, Australia. Having emerged in 2009, they maintain all the angst and aggression of conventional hardcore, however have crafted a fresh and innovative approach to modern metalcore into their style.\\n\\nThe current lineup: \\nMarcus Bridge - Vocals (2014-)\\nJon Deiley - Guitar (2009-)\\nJosh Smith - Guitar (2009-)\\nNic Petterson - Drums (2010-)\\nBrendon Padjasek - Bass/Backing Vocals (2018-)\\n\\nPast Members:\\n\\nAdrian Fitipaldes – Vocals (2009–2014)\\nBrendan Derby – Drums (2009)\\nMitchell Collier – Drums (2010)\\nSimon Anderson – Bass (2010–2011)\\nAlex Milovic – Bass (2009-2010, 2011-2018)\\n\\n2010 Debut EP - Hollow Existence\\n2011 Debut Album - Discoveries\\n2013 Sophomore Album - Singularity\\n2015 Third Album - Node\\n2017 Fourth Album - Mesmer\\n\\nThe band hit the stage in mid-2009, delivering powerful and dynamic live performances. Their popularity soared, with local attention rapidly amounting to national support with each show. Within a year, Northlane were a common name, demanded across the nation due to their reputation as one of the tightest bands; they are known for their ‘take no prisoners’ attitude when it comes to buckling down and working hard with a DIY attitude.\\n\\nIn early 2010, Northlane released their debut six-track EP, titled “Hollow Existence”, which they co-produced in a friend’s garage studio. Their debut full length album Entitled “Discoveries”, which was labelled by Kill Your Stereo as “Australian album of the year” coincided with their signing to We Are Unified and was released to much anticipation on 11-11-11, straight off the back of a 24 date regional headline tour.\\n\\nDiscoveries was a game changer for Northlane, the critical acclaim following it’s release was unprecedented and their fanbase exploded almost overnight, finally the unrelenting kilometres on the road, and service station pies were paying off. The Discoveries tour in support of this release was by far their most successful tour to date, once half empty rooms were now packing out across the whole country.\\n\\nIn September 2012, the band started to play it\\'s first shows in North America, playing The Eastern Canada Tour with Stray From The Path, Obey The Brave and others.\\n\\nThe band released their sophomore album \\'Singularity\\' on March 22, 2013. The album was received very well and was the #1 album on established Australian radio show Short.Fast.Loud\\'s mid year report. Singularity resulted in 2013 becoming the year in which Northlane began to tour heavily outside of Australia.\\n\\nThis led the band on a Singularity album tour, where they sold out many shows. The toured Canada again afterwards in support of Structures and Texas In July. After returning to Australia for a regional headlining tour, they played in Europe for the first time, on the Never Say Die! tour with Emmure headlining in October. They are also set to play in the United States for the first time in November and December, in support of Veil of Maya and Structures, and with support from Vildhjarta and Here Comes The Kraken, despite never playing a show in the United States before. \\n\\nIn January 2014 they played on the Big Day Out touring festival, before touring the USA with Bring Me The Horizon, Of Mice and Men and Issues on the American Dream tour. In March and April they supported Architects on a 39 date tour of Europe and the UK. Northlane announced that they would curate their own festival called FREE YOUR MIND, with the first tour taking place in May 2014 in Australia. Northlane headlined the festival with support from Thy Art Is Murder, Veil Of Maya, Volumes and Make Them Suffer. All dates on the tour sold out in advance. Northlane appeared on the cover of Blunt Magazine in the April edition prior to Free Your Mind. It was after this tour that Northlane became activists and heavily supported many charities including The Smith Family by donating used drums sticks and guitars.\\n\\nIt was announced in September 2014 that founding vocalist Adrian Fitipaldes would be leaving the band. Northlane issued a statement via their Facebook page, citing an impact on Fitipaldes\\' health as the catalyst. Northlane also announced that they will be accepting audition videos for a new vocalist.\\n\\nOn 14 October, Northlane announced that they had found their new vocalist. Then on 16 October, the band announced that they were shooting a music video for \"Rot\" with the new singer. The track was recorded with Will Putney in Sydney. Citing the new single as \"one of the heaviest Northlane tracks ever\", the band debuted the song on 20 November, along with the new vocalist being identified as Marcus Bridge.\\n\\nThe band announced they were recording a third full length album in March with Will Putney.

       " {'name': 'Obey the Brave',\n",
       "  'bio': 'In the years since the phrase, “that which does not kill us makes us stronger” was first attributed to German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, it’s become something of a tired cliché. But to an underground band like OBEY THE BRAVE, relentlessly touring the world’s clubs, against obstacles great and small, the maxim still carries the weight of reality. Like the best of the heavy metallic hardcore bands in rock music history, OBEY THE BRAVE embodies Nietzsche’s stark sentiments with furious musical determination.\\n\\nOBEY THE BRAVE churns out anthems of empowerment born of adversity. It’s the songs that embolden the spirit and exorcise personal demons, whether in the pit or on a day’s commute. Songs like “Raise Your Voice,” “Full Circle,” and “Get Real” are quintessential metalcore bangers.\\n\\nMad Season, the band’s diverse and defiant third album, arrives after the most turbulent period of the group’s career. Yet as vocalist Alex Erian puts it with appropriately blunt eloquence: “We’re back stronger than ever.”\\n\\nSince forming just a handful of years ago in their native Canada, OBEY THE BRAVE has toured the world alongside fellow modern metalcore genre standard bearers like The Amity Affliction, Whitechapel, Blessthefall, Chelsea Grin, Emmure, All Shall Perish, We Came As Romans, and Miss May I, forging meaningful relationships with each audience, show after show.\\n\\nA series of hardships and obstacles followed the release of the group’s well-received sophomore album, Salvation (2014), which built upon the early promise Young Blood (2012). Both are albums full of raw crunch, sincere attitude, metallic bite, and unadulterated adrenaline. The group weathered two lineup changes, a string of bad luck with an overseas promoter, and a series of false starts in the studio before finally emerging with Mad Season, the band’s most focused, ambitious, and urgently visceral album thus far.\\n\\nSongs like “Drama,” “The Distance,” and “Rest in Peace” (one of two Mad Season songs delivered entirely in the band’s native French) are packed with power derived as much from real life emotion as huge power chords.\\n\\nNamed for the tumultuous period of its creation, Mad Season is a truly collaborative effort musically and lyrically. Joining shortly into the touring cycle for Salvation, Terrence McAuley (guitar) and Cory Wilson (bass) gelled instantly with original members Erian, John Campbell (guitar), and Stevie Morotti (drums). McAuley also served as co-producer, alongside engineer and mixer Dean Hadjichristou, who has worked with Obey The Brave’s fellow Canadians Protest The Hero and labelmates Parkway Drive.\\n\\nWhen it came time to record vocals, Erian reunited with longtime collaborator Antoine Lussier, whose Ion Dissonance bandmate, Kevin McCaughey, guests on “The Distance.” “RIP” features French Canadian rap group Loud Lary Ajust, capturing the party element the band often brings in the live setting.\\n\\n“Drama” boasts a guest appearance from Steve Marois of Erian’s other band the semi-recently reformed deathcore pioneers Despised Icon.\\n\\n“I grew up in the death metal scene but Obey The Brave has always been my outlet to explore other aspects of my musical roots and passions,” Erian explains. “Now that Despised Icon is back, I have that outlet for really heavy extreme music, so I can explore with Obey The Brave even more now.”\\n\\nMad Season demonstrates a true artistic evolution for the band. Part of that progression includes the introduction of singing vocals alongside the genre’s traditional screaming. This isn’t “emo” crooning, however; it’s much more akin to the raspy declarations of Rise Against and old-school punk.\\n\\n“We stepped out of our comfort zone with this record,” Erian says. “We didn’t want to put out the same record three times in a row. I spent an entire year trying to perfect my singing. There’s still a lot of screaming on the album, but it was really important for me artistically to try something different and give it my all. It’s very exciting to try to reinvent yourself.”\\n\\nA mission statement of sorts for OBEY THE BRAVE is right there in the title track: “We all want it / it’s our passion / we’re all lost in the right direction.”\\n\\n“Sometimes when you’re facing these obstacles, you’re like, ‘why am I still here? Why am I doing this in the first place? Should I get back to the regular nine-to-five and try to get some security?’” Erian confesses. “But this is who I am. This is what I do. This is who we are. We just can’t help ourselves. That’s why ‘though we may feel ‘lost,’ we are lost in the right direction.”\\n\\nUltimately each and every step along the way for OBEY THE BRAVE has been worth it, because indeed, “that which does not kill us…” Or to quote another fitting well-known proverb: “nothing ventured, nothing gained.”\\n\\n“In a weird twisted way I’m thankful for everything it took to get this record made because it all tested our commitment to the band and we’re still here, you know, we’re still swinging,” says Erian. “The bottom line is, we put so much of ourselves into Mad Season and the music speaks for itself.”  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Obey+the+Brave\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Passion Pit',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Passion Pit is an American indietronica band from Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States, formed in 2007. The band consists solely of Michael Angelakos (lead vocals, keyboards), joined live by Chris Hartz (drums), Aaron Harrison Folb (bass/synthesizers), Giuliano Pizzulo (guitar/synthesizers), and Ray Suen (guitar/synthesizers).\\n\\n\"Passion Pit\" was a vocabulary word used in a class Michael took in school. The band called their name from the Variety Slanguage Dictionary, a glossary of Variety\\'s frequently-used slang, which was provided by the Hollywood Insider publication to help not-so-savvy readers decipher its content. The magazine used the term to refer to drive-in theatres, because of their privacy and romantic allure for teenagers.\\n\\nThe first Passion Pit songs, which would later become the Chunk of Change EP, were written by Angelakos at Emerson College as a belated Valentine\\'s Day gift to his then-girlfriend. At first, he wrote and performed all his material alone using a laptop. These sets of songs were passed around Emerson and caught the attention of many blogs.\\n\\nMichael played his first shows alone sitting with his laptop and a microphone. After one of these solo shows in the Boston area, Ian Hultquist, who was attending Berklee at the time, approached Angelakos and expressed interest in creating and playing music collaboratively. After a few line-up changes, Passion Pit was born. They formed a group that consisted of Angelakos, Hultquist, Ayad Al Adhamy, Thom Plasse (bass), and Adam Lavinsky (drums). The band spent a considerable amount of time trying to flesh out a collaborative format and structure that would work best for them. Jeff Apruzzese and Nate Donmoyer joined the band shortly after they signed to Frenchkiss in 2008, replacing Plasse and Lavinsky, respectively. In 2012, Adhamy was replaced by Xander Singh.\\n\\nThe band\\'s debut EP, \"Chunk of Change\", was released on September 16, 2008. The first four tracks were those that Angelakos had written as a gift for his girlfriend, which had already become popular throughout Emerson where he had been passing out his own, self-produced copies. Two tracks, \"Better Things\" and \"Sleepyhead\", were added for the commercial release of the EP. The same year of their debut EP\\'s release, the band was chosen as \"Best New Local Act in 2008\" in the WFNX/Boston Phoenix best music poll.\\n\\nThe first and only single to be released from the EP, \"Sleepyhead\", received a good deal of exposure through its use in numerous media campaigns and advertisements, while the video for the song, directed by The Wilderness, was included on Pitchfork\\'s Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 list. The song contains samples of \"Óró Mo Bháidín\" by Irish singer and harpist Mary O\\'Hara.\\n\\nOther songs from the EP received some exposure as well. \"Cuddle Fuddle\" was featured in E4\\'s second series of The Inbetweeners and \"I\\'ve Got Your Number\" was used in an advertisement for the cash card from O2, Money in the UK.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe band\\'s first full-length studio album, Manners, was released on May 18, 2009 in the UK and May 19, 2009 in the United States and Canada. In celebration, the band played their record release party on the 18th in New York City on a Rocks Off boat cruise. In a preview article, ClashMusic.com commented that the album \"has every chance to rank as one of the year\\'s best\" and that \"it reveals additional nuances with each visit: a sure-fire sign of an album with true longevity\".\\n\\nIn order to obtain a specific background vocal accompaniment the band was looking for on Manners, Passion Pit enlisted the help of the PS22 chorus, who recorded vocals in-studio for three of the album\\'s songs: \"The Reeling\", \"Little Secrets\", and \"Let Your Love Grow Tall\".\\n\\nPassion Pit made their television debut on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday, July 29th, 2009 performing their song \"The Reeling\" from the album.\\n\\n\"The Reeling\" was the first single to be released from the album and found success on the Billboard Alternative Songs chart in the fall of 2009, where it peaked at number 34 in October. \"Little Secrets\" was the third single to be released and had success on the chart as well, topping out at number 39. \"Let Your Love Grow Tall\" was never released as a single but had some exposure being used in the sixteenth episode of the fourth season of the TV series Ugly Betty.\\n\\nThe album\\'s second single, \"To Kingdom Come\", was used in the Rhapsody commercial for its iPhone application.\\n\\n\"Sleepyhead\" was the only track from Chunk of Change to be included on the album and was made available from iTunes for free as a discovery download in 2009. The song continued to receive additional exposure through its appearances in advertisements. It was used in a season 3 episode of the teen-drama, Skins, and most recently in the debut trailer for LittleBigPlanet 2, which led to the band\\'s increased popularity amongst fans and players of the game, who eventually created an in-game instrumental version of the song to listen to in the first game. When the sequel was released, it came with the song\\'s actual instrumental version used in the trailer. This song has also been used in an advertisement for the Palm Pixi and the Canadian PSP.\\n\\nThe song \"Moth\\'s Wings\" was used in the fourth episode of the third season of the CW teen drama Gossip Girl and in the closing credits of episode 36 of HBO\\'s Big Love. It appeared in the FIFA 10 video game and was featured in the film Life As We Know It, starring Katherine Heigl and Josh Duhamel. Additionally, the track has been used as a background theme for Sky Sports\\' coverage of the UEFA Champions League and as the music for a dance routine in Episode 5, Season 8, of the US television show So You Think You Can Dance (United States), which received a standing ovation from the show\\'s judges. It was also featured in MTV\\'s show Awkward.\\n\\nOn April 13, 2010, the band reissued Manners in a deluxe edition format which contained new artwork and three additional tracks: stripped-down versions of \"Sleepyhead\" and \"Moth\\'s Wings\" and a cover of The Cranberries\\' song \"Dreams\". The deluxe release coincided with the extension of their North American headlining tour.\\n\\nThe band released another cover in June 2010, this time offering up their take on The Smashing Pumpkins hit song \"Tonight, Tonight\" as part of a promotion with Levi\\'s called \"Pioneer Sessions\".\\nIn September 2010, Passion Pit toured with the English band Muse as their opening act for eight shows during their fall tour through parts of the U.S.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn an August 2010 interview with NME, Angelakos stated that work had already begun on the follow-up to Manners and that the band intended to release the album in the spring of 2011. He then said that it will be released early in 2012.\\n\\nOn April 24, 2012, Angelakos announced the title of the album, Gossamer, and that it would be released on July 24, 2012.\\n\\nOn May 7, the first track from Gossamer was released, called \"Take a Walk\".\\n\\nOn June 12, the second track from Gossamer was released, called \"I\\'ll Be Alright\". The track leaked early on June 11th and was released as an NME premiere on June 8.\\n\\nOn July 9, a third track from Gossamer, called \"Constant Conversations\", was reviewed and featured as \"best new track\" by Pitchfork. It was released with the review as streamed content.\\n\\nPassion Pit officially released their second album, Gossamer, on July 20, 2012 to critical acclaim.\\n\\nOn July 16th, Angelakos posted on the Passion Pit website that the band has cancelled the remaining July tour dates and suspended the tour in order for Angelakos to seek ongoing treatment for bipolar disorder. A Rolling Stones interview stated that Angelakos was diagnosed at 17, undergoing therapy, hospital care, and medication ever since.\\n\\nOn October 13, they performed on Saturday Night Live. They played \"Take a Walk\" and \"Carried Away\".\\n\\nOn September 24, Passion Pit released the Constant Conversations EP, exclusively available on Spotify. The EP featured an alternative version of Constant Conversations from their 2012 album Gossamer, in addition to a formerly unreleased b-side called Ruin Your Day. The final track on the EP was a remix of Carried Away by Dillon Francis.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPassion Pit\\'s third studio album, Kindred, was released on April 17, 2015, preceded by the lead singles \"Lifted Up (1985)\", \"Where the Sky Hangs\", and \"Until We Can\\'t (Let\\'s Go)\". In anticipation of the release, the band posted several coded images to various social networking platforms. Soon after the release of the Morse code image, the official Passion Pit website, which had been under construction since the end of the 2013 tour, came back up as \"KindredTheAlbum.com\" (The website has since returned to \"passionpitmusic.com\".)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDuring February and March of 2017, several new Passion Pit songs were uploaded on YouTube on the account for The Wishart Group  (from the name of a project started by Michael Angelakos and dedicated to supporting musicians by providing them with legal, educational and healthcare services, with a focus on mental health, a topic on which Angelakos has been especially forthcoming), foreshadowing a fourth album for 2017. \\n\\nAll of the videos for those new songs have the same background photo (a woman wearing a white dress, located in the middle of the sea, turning around as though she had sensed she was being secretly observed from behind), as does the front cover of the album. The songs were taken down, but Angelakos announced that he will give a downloadable copy of the album for free to anyone who retweets neuroscientist Michael F. Wells\\' tweet on the importance of science and research. The profits from the album will be donated to a psychiatric research institution in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\\n\\nOn July 11, Passion Pit\\'s fourth album, Tremendous Sea of Love, was announced to be released on July 28 on all streaming services.\\n\\nThe band embarked on a North American tour between January and February 2018 to promote Tremendous Sea of Love as well as their EP Chunk of Change\\'s 10th anniversary.\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Passion+Pit\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

A producer of dark and retrofuturistic music inspired by the 80\\'s often referred to as synthwave or retrowave.\\nKent has a background as a guitar player in several black metal bands. Since 2012 he has produced electronic music inspired by cyberpunk culture and with inspiration from movies like Akira, Ghost In The Shell and The Running Man. He uses a variety of software synths in his productions, such as the emulators of old vintage synths like the OB-X or the CS-80. Since his debut EP Night Driving Avenger he has released four full-length albums, the latest of which is The Uncanny Valley on the Blood Music label, and has performed several live shows. Several of his tracks were featured in the 2012 game Hotline Miami and its 2015 sequel Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number. Perturbator\\'s EP Sexualizer was released in part to officially release the song \"Miami Disco\" and as a way to thank the developers of Hotline Miami. The success of the Hotline Miami games resulted in a greater amount of exposure to a mainstream audience.\\n\\nPerturbator released his fourth full-length album The Uncanny Valley on May 6, 2016 through Blood Music on a range of formats including Digibook CD, vinyl, and cassette tape. The album was met with generally positive reviews, with MetalSucks and Bloody Disgusting both writing in praise of it. Some versions of the album also included a bonus EP, with Kent writing that \"The first three songs complement the themes covered within The Uncanny Valley, and the final track—\\'VERS/US\\'—is a demo from The Uncanny Valley writing sessions that fits the mood and atmosphere of the album but didn\\'t quite make it into the final cut.\" Bloody Disgusting gave the album 5/5 and wrote that The Uncanny Valley \"is sure to not only please fans of the genre but also win over newcomers.\"\\nKent became interested in music in part due to the influence of his parents, who are journalists and rock music critics.

       "  'bio': 'Pigface is an industrial rock supergroup formed in 1990 by Martin Atkins and Bill Rieflin.\\n\\nBoth had drummed with Ministry, and were pleased with the notion of a rock music band with two drummers, rather than the usual one. The duo formed Pigface, and began a revolving-door collaboration with many experimentally-minded musicians, many of whom — especially early on — had recorded for the influential industrial music record label Wax Trax.\\n\\nTrent Reznor was also an early partner, when, due to legal troubles, Nine Inch Nails were prevented from recording under that name. \"Suck\" — cowritten with and sung by Reznor — was something of an underground hit, and Reznor later rerecorded the song.\\n\\nRieflin eventually left Pigface, leaving Atkins in charge. The dozens--perhaps hundreds--of musical collaborators to record and perform with Pigface have ensured that each album, and each song, is unique. This practice has, however, led to some negative criticism due to a perceived lack of continuity.\\n\\nPigface concerts are characterized by high-energy performances. Frequently there will be upwards of 10 people on stage at any time during the show. Not only that but Martin Atkins and the rest of the band love interacting with the audience, and members of the audience are nearly always invited on stage for the encore. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Pigface\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Following their 2003 debut Out of Myself, the band were signed by major prog label InsideOut, releasing Second Life Syndrome in 2005.

In the summer of 2007 Riverside supported Dream Theater in the European leg of their tour.\\n\\nIn 2009 they released their album  Anno Domini High Definition. Mariusz Duda had the following to say about the album on January 27, 2009: \"We have gone from Warsaw, we have changed the studio and the producer. We care deeply about creating a coherent record and that is why most probably there are only going to be five songs on it. The material will be energetic, multifarious, and - I hope so - very good for live performances. It will be a story about liquid modernity, life in a constant hurry, stress and anxiety about the future.

In addition to his work with the Go-Betweens, Forster has released several solo albums, including: Danger in the Past, recorded in Berlin in 1990; Calling from a Country Phone, recorded at Sunshine Studios, Brisbane, in 1993 with members of local pop group Custard; I Had a New York Girlfriend, a collection of cover versions recorded in Melbourne in 1994; Warm Nights, recorded in London in 1996 and produced by Edwyn Collins; and The Evangelist, recorded (all but one track - \"A Place to Hide Away\") at Good Luck Studios, London, September - November 2007 with long time collaborators Glenn Thompson and Adele Pickvance.\\n\\nCritically-acclaimed internationally as a songwriter, Forster reveals a strong literary influence in his work. In 2005, Forster began writing for the Australian magazine, The Monthly. Prior to this he had virtually no print experience, with only a column on hair care for a fanzine in the 1980s to his credit.

His live concerts usually include a considerable amount of story-telling, imaginative and surreal ad-libbed monologues in his lyrical style.  He is the son of novelist Raymond Hitchcock and the brother of artist Lal Hitchcock.\\n\\nHe regularly does solo work, and returns again and again to bands he has formed like The Soft Boys and The Egyptians.  Hitchcock is an avid and able collaborator with people like director Jonathan Demme, actor Alan Rickman, country/folk duo (and longtime Hitchcock fans) Gillian Welch and David Rawlings, The Venus 3,  R.E.M.\\'s Peter Buck, Young Fresh Fellows\\' frontman Scott McCaughey,  Andy Partridge of XTC, Nick Lowe, former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, Jon Brion, and Grant-Lee Phillips, as well as Ministry\\'s Bill Rieflin.  \\n\\nHitchcock\\'s musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by his appreciation of Bob Dylan, Gregory Corso, The Byrds, Country Joe & The Fish,  and Syd Barrett.  \\n\\nHitchcock\\'s lyrics are an essential component of his work, and tend to include surrealism, comedic songs, characterisations of English eccentrics, plant roots, insects, trains, dreams, and melancholy depictions of everyday life.  His themes include what many psychologists view as the roots of modern neurosis - namely, death, sex, and eating. (As if in recognition of these themes, he released an EP in 2007 called \"Sex, Food, Death and Tarantulas\".)  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Robyn+Hitchcock\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Royal Trux was an American alternative rock band from 1987 to 2001, founded by Neil Hagerty (vocals, guitar) and Jennifer Herrema (vocals).\\n\\nWhile still a teenager, Hagerty joined Washington DC garage punk band Pussy Galore, led by Jon Spencer, and subsequently relocated to New York. During his time in Pussy Galore, Hagerty convinced his bandmates to release a cassette-only remake of the entire Rolling Stones album Exile on Main Street. While he gained underground notoriety for his work with Pussy Galore, Hagerty reportedly viewed it as a job and intended to pursue his own artistic vision with his girlfriend, Jennifer Herrema, under the name Royal Trux.\\n\\nHagerty and Herrema released their first album, Royal Trux, in 1989. Then, after moving to San Francisco, Royal Trux released the experimental double-album Twin Infinitives.\\n\\nAfter Twin Infinitives, Royal Trux released an untitled album (sometimes referred to as the Skulls record because of its sleeve artwork). Forgoing the experimentalism of Twin Infinitives, the band instead opted for a more lo-fi approach, recording on an 8-track. This albumn was left untitled. The arguably atypical lyricism and sonic atonality of their first album was largely abandoned in favor of a more stripped, direct sound.\\n\\nFollowing the release of their untitled album, Hagerty and Herrema hired a guitarist and drummer in order to complete their fourth full-length, Cats and Dogs. The songwriting remained highly experimental, but was more melodic[citation needed], which was revealed on tracks such as \"The Flag,\" \"The Spectre,\" and \"Turn of the Century.\"\\n\\nDuring the corporate interest in underground music that followed Nirvana\\'s breakthrough success in 1991, Royal Trux signed a three-record contract totaling over one million dollars with the major label Virgin. They added a considerably heavier rhythm section with Dan Brown on bass guitar and Chris Pyle (son of Lynyrd Skynyrd drummer Artimus Pyle) on drums. They also added a percussionist named Rob Armstrong for a short period. In 1995, they released \"Thank You,\" recorded almost completely live in the studio with producer David Briggs. Next came \"Sweet Sixteen\". While the band received mainstream media exposure during their time on Virgin (Herrema appeared in Calvin Klein print and TV ads from 1995-2000), Virgin was reportedly unhappy with \"Sweet Sixteen\". The band was unwilling to record a third record for the label, but was persuaded when Virgin offered to pay for all costs. Royal Trux returned back to their old label Drag City.\\n\\nOn Drag City, the band released Accelerator. They followed this album with Veterans of Disorder in 1999, and Pound for Pound in 2000.\\n\\nRoyal Trux also released the triple-LP Singles, Live, Unreleased, as well as a pair of EPs and substantial video and webwork.\\n\\nHagerty and Herrema were often credited as Adam and Eve for their production work[citation needed]. They separated as a couple and dissolved the band following the release of Pound for Pound. Since then, both have recorded albums for Drag City; Hagerty under his own name and as The Howling Hex, and Herrema under the name RTX. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Royal+Trux\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

His replacement, Bob Fay, appeared on the band\\'s most acclaimed and consistent effort, 1994\\'s Bakesale, which saw the emergence of the songwriting talents of multi-instrumentalist Jason Loewenstein, and the follow-up Harmacy in 1996. \\nFay left the band before the sessions for The Sebadoh (1999), to be replaced by Russ Pollard. Following the tour to promote this album (2000), the band went on hiatus, with Barlow concentrating on his other project, the Folk Implosion, and Loewenstein working on material for his debut solo album At Sixes and Sevens, released in 2002. The two reunited to play concerts in late 2003 and the spring of 2004.\\n\\nIn 2006, III was reissued with a bonus disc and expanded liner notes. In 2007, the band (reunited with Eric Gaffney) will be touring.\\n\\nDiscography:\\n\\n    * The Freed Man (1989)\\n    * Weed Forestin\\' (1990)\\n    * The Freed Weed (1990)\\n    * III (1992)\\n    * Rocking The Forest (1992)\\n    * Sebadoh vs. Helmet (1990)\\n    * Smash Your Head On The Punk Rock (1992)\\n    * Bubble and Scrape (1993)\\n    * 4 Song CD (1994)\\n    * Bakesale (1994)\\n    * Harmacy (1996)\\n    * The Sebadoh (1999)\\n    * Defend Yourself (2013)\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sebadoh\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The Russian dance/pop singer Alexander Medvedev, born on May 20 1975 in Novosibirsk (correct tag Шура). He is a self-made artist who never studied music professionally acquiring his experience at the local restaurant in Novosibirsk where he had been singing since the age of 13. \\n\\n After completing the designer studies in the city of Riga, Latvia, he moved to Moscow to pursue music career under the pretence of being a foreign pop star. His personal life was wrapped in mystery despite his rapid shot to stardom and much talk caused by it nationwide. And the talk was not always a pleasant one. Giving him credit for his extraordinary gifts and merits in music people noted unanimously that he was very hard to deal with. \\n\\nThe rumor has it that Shura enraged the whole crew at the shooting of his first video Cold Moon. He was angry with just about everything; the plot, the cast, the crew, the director, even the weather. And he was expressing his indignation very fervently, stomping, shouting. He found two cross-dressers at the site of the filming (actually, Candyman gay club in St. Petersburg), brought them to cast and demanded 200 dollars\\' fee for each of the two. \\n\\n1997-1998 was the most fruitful period for him as he released his major hits Cold Moon \\\\Holodnaya luna\\\\, Summer Rains Ended \\\\Otshumeli letnye dozhdy\\\\ which were in heavy rotation and topped many charts and radio airplay counts. 2001 earned him another success with Do Good Things \\\\Tvori dobro\\\\ single. He was extensively touring Russia and it was the time when he started to develop his now trademark bizarre feminine outfits and iridescent stage persona. Another notable feature of the performer\\'s image was his toothlessness of which he constantly boasted, singing with conspicuous lisp (at least on his first three albums as he had had his teeth fixed later on). Since 2001 his fame began to fade and for the past 6 years he has moved out of the limelight. \\n\\nHe continues to tour Russia and post-Soviet countries today, performing chiefly his old material and playing small venues like night-clubs or private parties for business tycoons. In 2010 he put out a new single Balloons (Vozdushnye shary\\\\ to almost zero publicity. \\n\\nShura is reportedly gay though in May 2010 he revealed the prospect of marrying Liza, his long-time friend.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Shura\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

She followed her elder siblings into the music business, signing a major-label deal with Island at just 20 years of age. Born Sigrid Solbakk Raabe on September 5, 1996 into a music-loving family and brought up in the sunny seaport of Ålesund in western Norway, about 300 miles from Oslo, she was the youngest of three siblings, each of whom had their own musical career. Her sister Johanne was a classically trained singer who had studied in Italy and Spain, while her brother Tellef had tasted indie success at home with his own band. Growing up influenced by classic artists like Joni Mitchell, Chet Baker, and Neil Young, she was taught to play the piano at an early age by her grandmother and guitar by her brother, and for ten years was a dancer, studying several different styles.\\n\\nAfter a stint in her brother\\'s band, Sigrid turned her hand to songwriting and launched her solo career in October 2013 at the tender age of 16 with the single \"Sun,\" which saw her featured on NRK\\'s (Norwegian state television) hip tastemaker show Urørt (Untouched). Two further singles, \"Two Fish\" and \"Known You Forever,\" alongside spellbinding performances at several major European music festivals, sealed her reputation as a superbly talented songwriter and performer. With her rich, powerful, versatile voice and elfin good looks, she seemed ready-made for pop superstardom, and the ensuing bidding war finally saw her signed to Island. She delivered on the promise with her epic, anthemic debut single for the label, \"Don\\'t Kill My Vibe,\" released in February 2017. Co-written and produced by Martin Sjølie (Ella Henderson, Sam Smith), it was unveiled with much fanfare on BBC Radio 1, becoming their \"Hottest Record in the World,\" and immediately racked up millions of plays on streaming services. The equally successful single \"Strangers\" followed that November. Written and recorded in one take, the stripped-down single \"Focus\" arrived in 2018, along with her EP, Raw.

Tim met guitarist Harry Cody at a New Year\\'s Eve party and they formed a creative partnership which would last for many years to come. \\n\\nDuring the early 80\\'s, bassist Tim Tim (changing his name from Tim Sköld ) and guitarist Harry Cody formed the glam rock band Kingpin in their native Skövde, Sweden, inspired by the flamboyant hard rock bands flowing out of L.A. and UK acts such as Sigue Sigue Sputnik and Zodiac Mindwarp.\\n\\nThe band kicked off their career with a 7\" single titled \"Shout It Out\" (which hit #1 back in Sweden) in 1987 after drafting vocalist Zinny J. San and drummer Stixx Galore a short time later. Kingpin released their only Swedish album \"Welcome To Bop City\" 12\" LP the following year, followed by relocation to L.A.\\n\\nDiscovered and signed by Cliff Cultreri at Relativity Records, Kingpin changed their name to Shotgun Messiah, as a San Francisco-based band held the rights to the name Kingpin. Remixing and re-packaging their album, Shotgun Messiah self-titled it as their international debut in 1989.\\n\\nZan was let go soon after having MTV smash hits such as \"Don\\'t Care \\'Bout Nothin\\'\" and \"Shout It Out\" while the band was making a follow up to their debut self-titled album. They hired a new bassist, Bobby Lycon, from New York, and on Harry Cody\\'s suggestion Tim Tim took on the lead vocals. At this time, Tim Tim, whose role was now frontman, went by the name Tim Skold, dropping the umlaut. They released \"Second Coming\" in 1992, which was enthusiastically received by the media and came to be their most successful album to date. Two singles were released from that album, \"Heartbreak Blvd.\" and \"Living Without You\".\\n\\nShortly after, the band followed up with an E.P. entitled \"I Want More\" which contained some punk covers along with re-recorded songs from their previous album \"I Want More\", \\'Babylon\\' and an acoustic version of \"Nobody\\'s Home\". Soon after this release, Shotgun Messiah were down to two original members, Skold and Cody, seeing the departure of Stixx and Lycon.\\n\\nStill under contract with Relativity Records, Skold and Cody decided to go back to Sweden for the recording of the 3rd and final Shotgun Messiah album, leaning towards the industrial end of heavy metal and naming it \"Violent New Breed\". The album was released in 1993 and is now considered a cult classic due to the \\'before it\\'s time\\' incorporation of industrial influences. However, at the time of release it received mixed reviews and continued public indifference eventually convinced the two to call it a day, leading Tim to embark on his solo project, Skold.\\n\\nAfter the departure of Shotgun Messiah, Tim went on to pursue a solo career. Writing all songs and playing all instruments himself, his self-titled debut album, \"Skold\", was released in 1996 by record label RCA (and co-produced with Scott Humphrey).\\n\\nPromoting his debut album, SKOLD went on a short tour with (and in part as support for) Genitorturers. Some of the songs on the SKOLD album were used in movies like Disturbing Behavior (\"Hail Mary\"), Universal Soldier: The Return (\"Chaos\") and the Playstation game Twisted Metal (\"Chaos\"). During his solo career, Skold also did remixes for several bands such as Prong, Nature and Drown. He also met KMFDM frontman Sascha Konietzko during his time in the studio and even went to join his band a short time later.\\n\\nAfter his short-lived solo career, Skold went on to join KMFDM in 1997. His first involvement with KMFDM was on the album, \"Symbols\", which he contributed to with just one song. \"Anarchy\", which Skold wrote and provided vocals for, became a hit in clubs. His next album with KMFDM, entitled \"Adios\", was released in 1999. \"Adios\" saw Skold taking on a larger role in the band, not just as vocalist, writer and bassist, but also as producer, engineer and programmer alongside Konietzko.\\n\\nFollowing the 1999 Columbine High School Massacre incident (which happened the same day \"Adios\" was released) and the stigma of the shooters being avid fans, the band went on a short hiatus, forming the project mdfmk.\\n\\nFounded by Sascha Konietzko and Skold, they went on to release just one album simply titled \"mdfmk\" released in 2000 on Universal Records. The band, with Lucia Cifarelli (formerly of the band Drill), took on a more futuristic sound, which also contained hints of trance and europop, primarily in the style of production, leaning towards, what is now commonly referred to as \\'electronica\\'.\\n\\nMdfmk also featured all three sharing vocal duties. Their song \"Missing Time\" was used in the animated movie, Heavy Metal 2000. Skold, Konietzko and Cifarelli went on to reform KMFDM shortly after that.\\n\\nSkold, on bass, joined ohGr, a project of Skinny Puppy vocalist Nivek Ogre, for the tour in support of its first album, Welt, in 2001.\\n\\nSkold\\'s involvement with Marilyn Manson began as producer for the single \"Tainted Love\" which featured on the 2001 teen movie, Not Another Teen Movie, as well as the Not Another Teen Movie Soundtrack. Manson and Skold went on to score the movie Resident Evil, released in 2002. Several tracks are featured on the Resident Evil Movie Soundtrack.\\n\\nSkold officially joined Marilyn Manson in 2002 after the departure of bassist Twiggy Ramirez. At this time, not only was Tim the bassist for the band, but he was also credited with an impressive list of production talents such as producer, digital editing, artwork, electronics, drum programming and beats, along with playing guitar, keyboards, accordion and synthesizer bass for the Marilyn Manson 2003 release, \"The Golden Age Of Grotesque\".\\n\\nDue to Tim\\'s commitment as producer for Marilyn Manson\\'s 2003 album, \"The Golden Age of Grotesque\", he was not able to feature in the line-up for KMFDM\\'s 2002 Sturm & Drang tour, though he made two guest appearances on June 4th and 5th.\\n\\nHe is described by Manson as, \"the power that attitude brings to an album\". More of his production talents can be seen on the band\\'s 2004 release, \"Lest We Forget: The Best Of\", where Skold, besides being the producer, took on the role of lead guitarist and sang backup vocals on the cover version of \"Personal Jesus\", which featured on the best of record and was also released as a single. Coinciding with the release of The Nightmare Before Christmas in 3D in October 2006, Manson and Skold contributed a cover of \"This Is Halloween\" to The Nightmare Before Christmas soundtrack, which Skold did all the music for, while Manson sang vocals. This period also saw the start of work on Marilyn Manson’s sixth studio album, entitled \"Eat Me, Drink Me\", and released worldwide on June 5th, 2007.\\n\\nThrough the years with Marilyn Manson, Skold continues to prove he is a strong force to be reckoned with, becoming Manson\\'s right hand man. Skold participated in the first half of the 2007 Rape Of The World tour, but it was announced January 9th that Tim had officially left Manson, and that Rob Holiday would be replacing him on guitar for the remainder of the tour.\\n\\nAfter split with Marilyn Manson, Tim Skold went to compose soundtrack for the upcoming game Brütal Legend, along with Zakk Wylde, Wolfmother, Judas Priest, Black Sabbath, and Ronnie James Dio.\\n\\nOn December 16, 2008, it was announced on the KMFDM website that Tim Skold and Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM were working together for a new album, titled \"SKOLD VS KMFDM\", an 11-song album.\\n\\nSkold also did production on KMFDM\\'s 2009 album Blitz, and he has remixed for artists such as 16volt, Front Line Assembly and Left Spine Down.\\n\\nIn 2009 Skold released the EP Singles featuring three new solo songs I Will Not Forget, A Dark Star and Bullets Ricochet.  In April 2011 Skold released the EP Suck featuring remixes of the title track by artists 16Volt, Front Line Assembly, Combichrist and Bitteren Ende as well as including the tracks from the Singles EP.

       "  'bio': 'Saul Hudson (born 23 July 1965, Stoke, England), better known by his stage name Slash, is a British-American musician. He is the lead guitarist of the American hard rock band Guns N\\' Roses, with whom he performed and recorded between 1985 and 1996, Reuniting with the band in 2016.  He later formed Slash\\'s Snakepit and co-founded Velvet Revolver with his former bandmates Duff McKagan and Matt Sorum; and his debut solo album, Slash , was released in April 2010. In 2011 he wrote and featured on kick it Up a Notch, the end credit song for The Disney Channel Original Movie Phineas and Ferb: Across the 2nd Dimension. (Kick It Up a Notch Songfacts). He has written a self titled autobiography which was put to print  in 2007.\\n\\nSlash joined his first band, Tidus Sloan, in 1981. In 1983, he formed the band Road Crew—named for the Motörhead song \"(We Are) The Road Crew\"—with his childhood friend Steven Adler, who by then had learned to play drums. He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from Duff McKagan. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time Black Flag vocalist Ron Reyes, and worked on material that included the main riff of what would become the Guns N\\' Roses song \"Rocket Queen.\" Slash disbanded the group the following year due to them not being able to find a singer, as well as Adler\\'s lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan. He, along with Adler, then joined a local band known as Hollywood Rose, which featured singer Axl Rose and guitarist Izzy Stradlin. Following his time with Hollywood Rose, Slash played in a band called Black Sheep and unsuccessfully auditioned for Poison, a glam metal band that he would later openly deride.\\n\\nIn June 1985, Slash was asked by Axl Rose and Izzy Stradlin to join the newly founded Guns \"N\\' Roses. Duff McKagan and Steven Adler completed the line-up. They played nightclubs—such as the Whisky a Go Go, The Roxy, and The Troubadour—and opened for larger acts throughout 1985 and 1986. It was during this period that the band wrote most of its classic material, including \"Welcome to the Jungle,\" \"Sweet Child o\\' Mine,\" and \"Paradise City,\" As a result of their rowdy and rebellious behavior, Guns N\\' Roses quickly received the moniker \"Most Dangerous Band in the World,\" causing Slash to remark, \"For some strange reason, Guns N\\' Roses is like the catalyst for controversy, even before we had any kind of record deal.\" \\n\\nSlash has received critical recognition as a guitarist. In August 2009, Time Magazine ranked him #2 on its list of the \"10 Best Electric Guitar Players of All-Time\". He was also ranked #21 on Gigwise\\'s list of the \"50 Greatest Guitarists Ever\".\\n\\nSlash was the first musician to own a signature amplifier created by Marshall for him. In 1996 the Marshall Slash JCM 2555SL was launched, it was built with the specs of Slash\\'s own original 1987 Marshall Silver Jubilee 2555 amplifier. A total of 3000 of these amplifiers were made before it was discontinued.\\n\\nOn his self titled album,\"Slash\" he has worked with many artists like Ozzy Osbourne, Fergie (Black Eyed Peas), Myles Kennedy (Alter Bridge), Kid Rock and Ian Astbury (The Cult). The singles released from the album are \"Sahara\",\"Back From Cali\",\"By the Sword\" and \"Beautiful Dangerous\".  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Slash\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band currently consists of vocalist and guitarist Mike Ness, guitarist Jonny Wickersham, bassist Brent Harding and drummer David Hidalgo, Jr.\\n\\nSocial Distortion temporarily disbanded in 1985, due to frontman Ness\\' drug addiction and troubles with the law, which resulted in extended stints in various rehabilitation centers, that lasted for two years. However, the band reformed around 1986 and has remained active since then, even after the death of longtime guitarist Dennis Danell, who succumbed to a brain aneurysm in 2000. Since its inception the band lineup has been a virtual revolving-door of talent, with many members coming and going – Ness being the only constant member.\\n\\nTo date, Social Distortion has released seven full-length studio albums, two compilations, one live album, and two DVDs. The band released its debut album, Mommy\\'s Little Monster, in 1983, which was quite popular in the United States. Social Distortion did not release a second album, Prison Bound, until 1988. That album attracted the attention of Epic Records, who signed the band in 1989 and issued their highly successful self-titled third album a year later, which peaked at number 128 on the Billboard 200, and featured their well-known hit singles \"Ball and Chain,\" \"Story of My Life,\" and the cover of Johnny Cash\\'s \"Ring of Fire.\" The next two albums, Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell and White Light, White Heat, White Trash were also well-received but not as successful as the self-titled album.

And finally, the seventh and most recent studio album, Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes, was released on 18 January 2011.

Originally from Johannesberg, St. Lucia grew up performing with the Drakensberg Boys Choir School. When the choir wasn\\'t traveling - they toured Japan, Australia, Europe and more - they stayed in an enclave tucked in the South African mountains, learning everything from Bach to minimalist opera.\\n\\nA young musician could hardly find better training. But musically, St Lucia\\'s heart lay elsewhere, and South Africa was full of other rhythms. \"My mom says I used to sing along to Michael Jackson,\" he says - an ordinary anecdote, until he adds, \"when I was an infant.\" As a young teenager, he started to feel that he\\'d had his fill of classical, and it felt like an epiphany when he discovered the direct emotionality of pop. Eventually, he left the creative \"small pond\" of South Africa for England, where he spent three years studying music in Liverpool.\\n\\nSt. Lucia\\'s journey ended - as so many journeys do - in New York City, where he started working on the tracks that would ultimately turn into his self titled debut release on Neon Gold. The atmospheric quality of St. Lucia\\'s electronic pop is powerful, with the musician\\'s global travels and history of secret hideaways effortlessly passed onto the audience through his dreamy, shimmering synths.\\n\\nNeon Gold will release St Lucia\\'s debut album later this year.

Her songs take on the frenzied melodies of thoughts she can’t escape, and “Slow Motion” spurs from a headlong crush that “is not stopping for no one.” It’s also the first single from the newly minted Stef Chura Band, the polished outfit featuring drummer Ryan Clancy and experimental pop fixture Fred Thomas on bass.\\n\\nLove can be nauseating, and in a way, this song can be, too. Its conflicting time signatures and unexpected stops are as blunt and unforgiving as the false-starts to a relationship: “Right when it starts to feel like home/It’s time to go.” Even her vocals feel fastened to an unpredictable romance, warbling as she begs whatever’s happening to slow down. With the lo-fi charm of a Liz Phair cassingle, Chura retains the get-out-of-my-head immediacy that leads a person to sit down on the floor of their room and record a song until the feeling goes away. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stef+Chura\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       " {'name': 'Stereolab',\n",
       "  'bio': 'Stereolab are a UK-based band whose style, mixing 1950s–1960s pop and lounge music with the “motorik” beat of krautrock, was one of the first to which the term “post-rock” was applied. They are noted for the use of vintage keyboard instruments like Moog synthesizers and Vox and Farfisa organs. Stereolab is also notable for founding their own record label, Duophonic Records, with a grant from UK charity The Prince’s Trust. The band is often referred to as “The Groop” by their fans (and in the title of their song “The Groop Play Chord X” on the album Space Age Batchelor Pad Music).\\n\\nThey were founded in 1990 by songwriters Tim Gane (guitar, keyboards), formerly of the band McCarthy, and Laetitia Sadier (sometimes credited as Seaya Sadier; vocals, keyboards, trombone, guitar), who is from France and sings in both English and French.\\n\\nOver the years, Gane and Sadier have enlisted a large number of other musicians to accompany them on stage and on record. The initial line-up featured Martin Kean, formerly of The Chills, on bass, and Joe Dilworth (from their Too Pure label-mates Th’ Faith Healers) on drums, with Russell Yates (of Moose) and Mick Conroy (ex-Modern English) also appearing at early live shows. In 1993 they recruited Andy Ramsay (drums), who has remained in the group line-up ever since, and Mary Hansen (vocals, guitar, keyboards, percussion). Hansen’s distinctive backing vocals became an important aspect of the Stereolab sound, and she remained a regular feature of the line-up until her death in a cycling accident on December 9, 2002. Multi-instrumentalist Sean O’Hagan of The High Llamas has also been a frequent contributor, particularly with string, brass and keyboard arrangements to the band’s studio albums. John McEntire (Tortoise) has also contributed keyboard, electronic effects and studio help over the years. Other members have come and (in some cases) gone over the years, including Duncan Brown, Dave Pajo (from Tortoise), Richard Harrison and Simon Johns (all bass); Gina Morris (vocals); and Katharine Gifford and Morgane Lhote (both on keyboards).\\n\\nEarly Stereolab material displayed a heavy influence of krautrock sounds, particularly Neu! and Faust, characteristically relying on droning, repetitive guitar or keyboard riffs, with or without vocals. Early heavy use of distorted Farfisa combo-organ sounds were also reminiscent of early recordings by The Modern Lovers. As the band developed, they incorporated new instrumentation, and an increasingly complex sense of rhythm and structure, frequently making use of irregular time signatures as well as unorthodox chord progressions and melodic intervals. The band has often made copious use of female backing vocal lines.\\n\\nLyrically, Stereolab’s music is quirky (song titles evoke memories of 1950s science fiction stories, and are often borrowed directly from old films and records of the period, but have nothing to do with the song’s content), but highly politically and philosophically charged, sometimes with a decidedly Surrealist or Situationist bent. (Sadier notes the libertarian Marxist theoretician Cornelius Castoriadis as a particular inspiration.) Sadier’s lyrics, in both French and English, often read like highly condensed sociological texts, standing in deliberate and distinct counterpoint to the lush hedonic pop sound of the band. A prime example would be “Ping Pong” from Mars Audiac Quintet, which is an explicit restating of Marxist theory concerning the relationship between economic cycles and war cycles.\\nStereolab earned a minor place in the Britpop movement, with their sound proving influential to bands like Blur: occasional keyboard-driven b-sides and singer Damon Albarn’s love of retro keyboards showed the influence, and in recognition Laetitia Sadier was invited to provide vocals on “To The End” from Parklife.\\n\\nDespite the band’s fan base and critical acclaim, Stereolab has not achieved high levels of financial or popular success. On June 7, 2004, suits at the Warner Music label (to whom the band was signed in the U.S.) announced they were dropping Stereolab in response to the poor sales (40,000 to that date) of Margerine Eclipse. This was part of an ongoing effort by Warner to cut costs; The Breeders and Third Eye Blind were also dropped from the label for this reason. Laetitia Sadier is now also a member of Monade, which is essentially expressive of her own singular musical goals. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Stereolab\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Mining the catalogs of Robbie Basho, Sandy Bull, Michael Chapman, and Sonny Sharrock, among other titans of stringed-things, Steve has steadily processed these inspirations into a singular, virtuosic stream.  Close listening reveals the influence of Delta and Piedmont country blues, free jazz, and psych on the continually unfolding compositions. Friendships and collaborations with Jack Rose, Tom Carter, Meg Baird, and Michael Chapman colored the disciplined evolution of the deconstructed blues sound, at once transcendent and methodical, that is now Gunn’s signature.\\n\\nWith a career spanning nearly fifteen years, Steve has produced volumes of critically acclaimed solo, duo, and ensemble recordings.   Gunn’s 2009 solo masterpiece, Boerum Palace, demonstrated a fully realized power for songcraft. Steve started to sing more and developed a commanding vocal style equal to his guitar practice. His acclaimed instrumental duo recordings with Truscinski, Sand City (2010) and Ocean Parkway (2012), cemented his place among the top of his peers, both present and past. These documents display Gunn’s compositional penchant for charting musical travelogues that ramble through city and wilderness alike. Dispatches home are not merely descriptive but corporeal; the evocative, rhythmic power of his writing and phrasing carries the listener along bodily. Steve builds songs as exploratory vessels, opens them up for mechanical tinkering, and lives in them through ceaseless improvisatory permutations.\\n\\nTwo solo albums have been released on Three Lobed Recordings, and two albums as one half of Gunn-Truscinski Duo also released on Three Lobed.\\n\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Steve+Gunn\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

As of February 2017, they have since released five more studio albums: Does This Look Infected? (2002), Chuck (2004), Underclass Hero (2007), Screaming Bloody Murder (2011) and 13 Voices (2016).\\n\\nThe band was formed by singer-songwriter Deryck Whibley and drummer Steve Jocz, after Whibley convinced Jocz to join his band. Jocz was a drummer in another band and Whibley was convinced that \"he was the best drummer around\". The duo then added  Dave Baksh as lead guitarist a year later and after going through several bassists, ended up picking jason McCaslin to complete their lineup.\\n\\nOn May 10, 2006, Dave Baksh announced in a statement through his management company that he was leaving Sum 41 to work with his new band, Brown Brigade, which has a more \"classic metal\" sound. Baksh cited \"creative differences\" as the reason for his departure but claimed that he was still on good terms with the band.

       "  'bio': 'Sunny Sweeney (born December 7, 1976, in Houston, TX) is an American country music artist. \\n\\nSongfacts says: Texan Country artist Sunny Sweeney\\'s debut studio album, Heartbreaker\\'s Hall of Fame, was critically acclaimed but failed to impress radio, and none of the album\\'s three singles charted. However, she achieved a breakthrough when From a Table Away became her first record to enter the Hot 100 when it debuted at #96 on the chart dated January 22, 2011.\\n\\nBetween having three dogs named Merle, Nash, and Dolly and an East Texas accent so pronounced you could pick her out in a crowded honky-tonk from across the room, Sunny Sweeney is so country she probably snores Loretta Lynn melodies in her sleep. That much was clear long, long before she ever got around to recording her debut album, Heartbreaker\\'s Hall of Fame . So what the hell she was thinking when she skipped off to New York City shortly after graduation to pursue a career in theater or comedy instead of conquering the dancehall and opry circuit back home is anyone\\'s guess. Maybe she was just testing herself — making absolutely sure she was born to be a country singer, not just another pretty young improv-comedian from Longview, Texas, lighting up the Great White Way.\\n\\nOr, you know, maybe a waitress, nanny, dog walker or cubicle drone. Frankly, there was a spell there in her early 20s when seemed hell-bent on collecting as many different W-2s as she could instead of pursuing her destiny. And she actually did OK at the comedy thing — after leaving the Big Apple and returning to Texas to hook up with a comedy troupe in Austin. But every time a skit found her singing, it became more and more clear she was just putting off the inevitable. \\n\\n“My friends in the improv group kept saying, ‘Man, you should try singing,\\'” says Sunny. “At first I thought they meant ‘cause I wasn\\'t good at the comedy stuff, but they were just being supportive and wanted me to succeed at what they thought were my strongest points.”\\n\\nHer family seemed intent on pushing her in the right direction, too. Her step dad, a musician and songwriter himself, had tried to teach Sunny guitar when she was a child, but it didn\\'t stick. Years later, when he tried again, it did. So much so, she became obsessed. “He gave me a guitar for Christmas and taught me the three country chords: G, C and D,” she says. “The next day we drove to Colorado to go skiing, and I played the damn thing the entire way up there and back.”\\n\\nThat was all of three years ago. And she\\'s been making up for lost time — with a vengeance — ever since. She played her first “real” gig, fronting her own band , in September 2004 at Austin\\'s Carousel Lounge. In less than a year, she was holding down weekly residencies at multiple Austin honky-tonk bars and drawing a crowd at each show that countless other artists in the “Live Music Capital of the World” would kill for. She even scored a short tour or Europe, highlighted by sharing a bill with Dwight Yoakam at a festival in Norway. To say that even her most supportive friends were surprised not so much by her success as they were by how quickly she got her own ball rolling would be an understatement.\\n\\nMind, this all didn\\'t just fall into her lap. As she puts it with her characteristic, matter-of-fact bluntness, “I have busted my ass doing this. The crowds at home started coming pretty steadily after four of five months, but those first months were the longest months I\\'ve ever had. I booked myself on like over 200 shows the first year I had a band.”\\n\\n“This is the hardest I\\'ve worked on anything in my life,” she continues. “But I still cannot believe this is my job . I\\'m doing what I\\'ve always wanted to do, and, honestly, it\\'s the thing I\\'m supposed to do because I haven\\'t gotten fired yet!”\\n\\nBut the real proof that Sunny Sweeney is doing exactly what she\\'s supposed to be doing is all right there in her first record. Heartbreaker\\'s Hall of Fame , recorded in Floresville, TX and co-produced by Sunny with producers Tommy Detamore (guitar, pedal steel, lap steel, Dobro) and Tom Lewis (drums). It isn\\'t one of those quiet, timid little baby-steps records that slowly grows on you with hints of future potential. It explodes into the room with an ultra-confident, Texas-sized “HOWDY!” and demands your full attention — now . Kinda like the time Sunny, as a senior in high school, marched into a choir class and told the instructor she wanted to sing Dolly Parton\\'s “9 to 5” in the end-of-year-show — even though she wasn\\'t in the choir and the teacher had never met or heard her before. So Sunny belted out the song on the spot and walked out. (She got the gig — and an admonishment from the teacher for having not auditioned for the choir sooner.)\\n\\nListen to Sunny rip and swagger her way through the dozen songs on Heartbreaker\\'s Hall of Fame , and you can well understand that choir director\\'s frustration: Where has this gal been hiding until now? The first thing that grabs you is her voice — a big, bold and brassy instrument that brings to mind both the classic female county singers of the \\'60s and \\'70s that she grew up on as part of a country-music-loving family (both her grandfather and stepfather are musicians) as well as two of Sunny\\'s biggest modern influences, Natalie Maines and Kasey Chambers, at their most unapologetically untamed. It\\'s a voice that all but screams Sunny\\'s adopted slogan: “Get your honky-tonk on!”\\n\\nAnd on Heartbreaker\\'s Hall of Fame , Sunny does just that. From winning originals like “Ten Years Pass,” “Slow Singing Western Tunes” and the title track to classy covers of tunes by some of her favorite writers (including Iris Dement, Thom Schuyler, Keith Sykes, Audrey Auld and Jim Lauderdale, among others), it\\'s an album that has little in common with either pop country or even “Texas country.” It\\'s country, pure and simple — as primed for a Lone Star honky-tonk as it is the Grand Ole Opry or any radio station that still makes room for George and Tammy and Merle and Loretta. Clearly, Sunny knows the good country.\\n\\n“Growing up in East Texas, we had mostly country radio stations, but I was a child in the early \\'80s right when the genre had started its downfall,” she admits. “But the first time I heard Merle Haggard, I remember actually thinking, ‘Now this guy, his songs are worth a shit!\\' I\\'d hear something else I didn\\'t like, and then I\\'d hear the intro to a Merle song and my heart would stop. And I always loved Loretta, too, but it wasn\\'t until I got older that her lyrics really started to mean so much to me. It was from her that I learned that it\\'s OK to be yourself: write from your heart and what you know.”\\n\\nAnd here\\'s what Sunny knows now: this whole singing and writing country music for a living is even better than she ever dreamed it would be, even though she\\'s still getting the hang of doing it on her own. (She only recently hired a small but dedicated support crew to help out — leaving her more time to focus on writing, be at home in Austin with her dogs, or during her once-a-month trips to Nashville).\\n\\n“It does make me a bit crazy,” she says of the do-it-yourself route she\\'s chosen for her career so far. “But even though finding a label would be great, anyone that knows me knows that I won\\'t just settle for the first thing that comes along. I just know that if and when I ever get a chance to sign a record deal, it\\'s going to have to be my way or the highway. And that\\'s no joke! Because I\\'ve stuck to my guns through all of this and only play the kind of country music that I want to play, and the fans that I have all seem to dig it, too.”\\n\\n“That\\'s the coolest part to me,” she marvels, “that people actually come to a show to see me . That still freaks me out — but I love every minute of it!”\\n <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Sunny+Sweeney\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Ever since Pete Townshend coined the term “power pop” in 1967, fans, critics and musicians alike have clung to its principles of crunchy guitars, smooth harmonies and tales of tragic young love, in the never-ending battle to keep rock and roll’s flame burning brightly.\\n\\nTaylor Knox is poised to make a significant contribution to the cause when his debut solo EP, ‘Lines,’ is released March 31 on MapleMusic Recordings. With six tracks, each consistently clocking in at around three minutes, ‘Lines’ is the perfect taste to get the unsuspecting listener permanently hooked on Knox’s irresistible sugar high. From opening track “My Backyard” to meditative closer “Good Enough,” the Toronto native displays songwriting prowess far beyond his years, conjuring the magic of Big Star and Revolver-era Beatles.\\n\\nWhile everything about ‘Lines’ sounds effortless, Knox’s diverse skill-set is in part a result of the time-honoured music biz tradition of paying one’s dues. Although still in his twenties, he has a wealth of experience playing with a host of Canada\\'s most acclaimed artists, including Owen Pallett, Rich Aucoin, Luke Doucet, Hayden, and Jason Collett.\\n\\nTaylor Knox is now ready to step out on his own for good as a singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer.\\n\\nHis rock and roll journey began about a decade ago when he received an offer to play drums for The Golden Dogs—one of Canada’s most criminally-unappreciated bands, who also happened to be one of Knox’s favourites.\\n\\nDuring his stint with The Golden Dogs, Knox forged friendships with several other band members who would go on to form Zeus, a bond that led Knox to be a frequent presence at Zeus’s Toronto studio, Ill Eagle, which offered him the perfect environment to begin experimenting with his own material. From there, Knox and the still-gestating Zeus were tapped by Jason Collett to be his regular band, a move that brought Knox into contact with an even wider circle of musicians.\\n\\nHe joined up with Luke Doucet, playing drums on the tour in support of his acclaimed ‘Steel City Trawler’ album, and at about the same time lent his drumming talents to Hayden for the 2013 album ‘Us Alone’ and subsequent tour. Most recently, Knox has been playing with pop wunderkind Rich Aucoin, which has further expanded Knox’s musical vision.\\n\\nStill, those hearing Knox for the first time may hear immediate echoes of Sloan. It seems only natural given his friendship with Andrew Scott, drummer for the Halifax legends, whom Knox met when The Golden Dogs played several shows in support of Sloan. Scott has since served as Knox’s drummer on occasion. While the spirit of the ‘90s Halifax pop explosion is noticeable in Knox’s work, he has channeled it into an instantly memorable sound thoroughly his own by finally strapping on a guitar and bringing his lanky frame out from behind the drum kit.\\n\\nPower pop may be harder than ever to define, but great songs remain its foundation. Taylor Knox has a lot of them to offer, and ‘Lines’ is just the beginning. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Taylor+Knox\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

Hecker initially recorded under the moniker Jetone, but has become known internationally for recordings released under his own name, such as Harmony in Ultraviolet (2006) and Ravedeath, 1972 (2011). He has released eight albums and a number of EPs in addition to collaborations with artists such as Ben Frost, Daniel Lopatin, and Aidan Baker. His latest album Love Streams was released on his new label 4AD on 8 April 2016.\\n\\nBorn in Vancouver, Hecker is the son of two art teachers who spent his formative years developing an interest in music. He moved to Montreal in 1998 to study at Concordia University and explore his artistic interests further. After completing his studies, Hecker pursued a professional career outside music and worked as a political analyst for the Canadian Government. After leaving his employment in 2006 he enrolled at McGill University to study for a PhD, with a thesis on urban noise that was published in 2014. He has also worked as a lecturer in sound culture the Art History and Communications department. He initially performed internationally as a DJ (Jetone) and electronic musician.\\n\\nHis early career was characterized by an interest in techno, using the Jetone moniker he released three albums and performed DJ sets. By 2001 he became disenchanted with the musical direction of the Jetone project. In 2001, Hecker released the album Haunt Me, Haunt Me Do It Again, under his own name through the label Alien8. It explored abstract notions of sound and collages that was described as \\'very brutal, bloody, bone-crushing experiences\\'. In 2006 he moved to Kranky where he released his fourth album Harmony In Ultraviolet. His current method of working involves the use of pipe organ sounds which are digitally processed and distorted. For the album Ravedeath, 1972, Hecker travelled to Iceland where together with Ben Frost, he recorded parts in a church. In November 2010, Alien8 re-released Hecker\\'s debut album on vinyl.\\n\\nLive performances contain improvisations by processing organ sounds that are manipulated, with great fluctuations in volume.\\n\\nIn 2012, Hecker collaborated with Daniel Lopatin (who records as Oneohtrix Point Never) on an improvisatory project which became Instrumental Tourist (2012). Following 2013\\'s Virgins, Hecker convened once again in Reykjavik for sessions across 2014 and 2015, to create what would become Love Streams. Collaborators include Ben Frost, Johann Johannsson, Kara-Lis Coverdale and Grimur Helgason, whilst the 15th century choral works by Josquin des Prez birthed the foundations of the album. In February 2016, it was announced that Hecker had joined 4AD while his eighth album was released in April of that year.

       "  'bio': 'Tinariwen (plural of ténéré \"desert\") is a band of Tuareg-Berber musicians from the Sahara Desert region of northern Mali. The band\\'s fifth album Tassili, released in 2011, won the Award for Best World Music Album at the 54th Grammy Awards.\\n\\nFormed in 1982, in strikingly unusual circumstances for a musical ensemble, Tinariwen blend ancient musical traditions with radical contemporary politics. Despite severe natural and man-made hardships, young Kel Tamashek exiles continued performing the traditional music of their Tuareg forebears in the southern Sahara while simultaneously fighting against the government of Mali. \\n\\nForced to seek an alternative to starvation and repression in drought-stricken Mali, many of these young nomads hoped to attain a better life by striking up what proved to be an uneasy alliance with Libya. The hoped-for aid in their struggle with the Mali government failed to materialize, but in the meantime some of the rebels had evolved a form of music that kept alive the music of their forefathers while simultaneously communicating radical political messages. This music is known as tishoumaren, music of the ishumar (the unemployed). Usually performed by groups of 30 and more instrumentalists and singers, tishoumaren acknowledges contemporary western music, especially rock, as well as other music forms prevalent in the Middle East, while never losing touch with the original ancient form. In some instances, players not only adapt traditional forms but also substitute modern instruments for the traditional lutes, flutes and one-string violins. The electric guitar in particular has become popular, even though circumstances demand the availability of portable generators.\\n\\nThe name chosen by this band, Tinariwen, means empty places, thus maintaining a further link to the vast desert regions of the southern Sahara. The musicians include Said Ag Ayad, Alhassane Ag Touhami, Eyadou Ag Leche, Ibrahim Ag Alhabib, Abdallah Ag Lamida, Abdallah Ag Alhousseyni and Bassa Walet Abdoumou.\\n\\nThe music itself is spare and haunting, an aural reflection of those same open spaces. The lyrics of their songs, perhaps more accurately termed sung poetry, carry outspoken political thought that draws attention not only to repression in Mali, but also to the enforced exile of many and the continuing struggle for self-determination of the Tuareg nomads. Song structures are many and varied and include elemental call-and-response patterns as well as (to western ears) discordant notes that call to mind the blue notes favoured by western blues and jazz players overlaid upon a solid four-beat rhythmic foundation that is itself uncommon to the region although compatible with much western popular music.\\n\\nTinariwen\\'s first recordings were to cassette, sales and even possession of which carried harsh penalties in Mali and Algeria. In the early 00s, availability of albums encouraged more widespread awareness of the music and its underlying political messages. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Tinariwen\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

It was recorded by Alex Estrada at Earth City Studios and Mastered by Paul Miner(Suicide File, New Found Glory, Unbroken).\\n\\nWest Coast Hardcore powerhouse, 6131 Records(Alpha&Omega, Swamp Thing, Bad Seed) has teamed up with Geoff Rickly\\'s new vinyl-only Collect Records(United Nations) to release this record in a beautiful duel LP/CD package.\\n\\nAfter a spot on this year\\'s Sound and Fury festival, the band will be touring extensively in support of \"...To the Beat of a Dead Horse,\" with dates along side friends La Dispute and Envy among many others.\\n\\nOn November 19, 2010 it was announced that the band had signed to Deathwish records and will enter the studio this winter to record their new album, to be released in early 2011. \\n\\nOn February 21, 2011 it was announced that their new record \"Parting the Sea Between Brightness and Me\" was finished and will be soon released on Deathwish records. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/+noredirect/Touche+Amore\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

       "  'bio': 'Weyes Blood (originally Weyes Bluhd) is Natalie Mering, a musician from Philadelphia, PA, United States, and ex Jackie-O Motherfucker bass player.\\n\\nHer solo work is raga-inspired, psychedelic music, using guitar strings as basic sound material and sound effects as an instrument. Home-made one string bass stick used to produce low bell-like sounds out of an horror movie. Most tracks have vocals, usually strangely deformed through effect pedals. Track editing and cueing is kept to a minimum in the DIY, abrupt tradition, giving freshness to the music.\\n\\nWeyes Blood has existed since at least 2006, starting as a conventional folk singer in an unamplified universe, then transforming into a more a crouched/hieroglyphic electronic chasm style, culminating in a European tour with Axolotl. After two seasons of hibernation and a relocation to Baltimore, she materialized her evolution and began writing/playing the darkly haunted narcotic drifter ballads that make up \"The Outside Room\", her first official full-length. The entire album was recorded, mixed and produced by Mering herself, then mastered by good friend Graham Lambkin. The record has shadows of \"The Shadow Ring\" in the oddly creaking ambient sounds and stark, nuanced production, which lend the eerily beautiful folk laments à la Nico. There’s still echoes of her old drone / tape-ghost-clouds moods on tracks like \"In the Isle of Agnitio\" and the long, bells-laden outro to \"Romneydale\", but the bulk of the LP is swooning and sweeping, with Natalie’s gorgeous, quasi-Teutonic vox leading the way. <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Weyes+Blood\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.

The band norwegian band WildSide started out in late 2005. Formed by drummer Ronny Arntzen and ex-Pagan\\'s Mind guitarist Thorstein Aaby. To complete the line-up, vocalist Paul Martin and bassplayer Johnny Myren was hired. Myren did not stay in the band for long, and in came a much more competent bassist, Stian Stensrud. In the begining the band was mainly playing cover tunes, but a couple of original tracks also surfaced. Early 2007 a two track demo featuring Nite Show and Calling Past was recorded. Shortly thereafter Aaby\\'s health got worse, so the band decided to get a stand-in guitarist. Tom Grana, and old friend of Stensrud joined the ranks. This worked out really well, so the plan was to go for a twin guitar attack when Aaby got back. Unfortunally that never happend, cause on july 24th 2007 Thorstein Aaby died of cancer. In november of 2007 the band entered Ronny Le Tekrö\\'s(TNT\\'s legendary guitarist) Studio Studio to record their debut album, Indication. But some problems followed, and the album wasn\\'t released until october of 2008, then only in Scandinavia. Enter 2009 and things looked promising for the band; WildSide recruited a second guitarist, the highly skilled youngster Jon Aarseth, adding an extra dimension to both studio and live preformances of the band. But shortly after singer Paul Martin decided to quit due to personal reasons. But WildSide turned the change into somthing good, and in came the entuhsiastic Joachim Berntsen, with a voice that suited the band very well. After some very well recieved gigs the band went into the studio again their second album, Speed Devil. This time in Klyve Lydstudio in Skien, Norway. The production was done by the band themselves, while the mixing was done by King Diamond guitarist Andy LaRoque at his Sonic Train Studios in Sweden. Speed Devil marked a huge step in the right direction, and is scheduled for release in May 2010. So watch out, folks!  <a href=\"https://www.last.fm/music/Wild+Side\">Read more on Last.fm</a>.
